- AI Chat: all modes now use `loki quick` for focused changes (standard mode was incorrectly running `loki start` with PRD)
- AI Chat: strip ANSI escape codes from output (raw `[0;32m` codes no longer shown)
- AI Chat: detect uncommitted + staged + committed file changes (not just HEAD~1)
- mktemp fix in run.sh: macOS `mktemp` with `.sh` suffix doesn't expand X's -- use rename instead
- Backend tests: skip auth/models tests when optional deps (python-jose, sqlalchemy) not installed
- E2E tests: handle OnboardingOverlay blocking clicks, fix selectors for actual UI

### Fixed
- loki web stop now kills only Purple Lab sessions (tracked PIDs), leaves external sessions alone
- loki web stop also stops Loki Dashboard on port 57374
- Orphan process cleanup: kills entire process tree with SIGKILL escalation

## [6.44.1] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- Start Build does nothing: add setIsRunning(true) after startSession so the UI enters running state immediately
- File DELETE API: send path in JSON body instead of query param (was causing 422 Unprocessable Entity)
- File SAVE API: include path in request body alongside content (was missing, causing 422)
- Config tab provider buttons: add onClick handler, api.setProvider call, and active state highlighting
- _kill_orphan_loki_processes: run via executor to avoid blocking the event loop

### Removed

### Added
- Workspace tab system in Project Workspace: Code, Preview, Config, Secrets, PRD tabs for structured navigation
- Build controls: Stop, Pause, Resume buttons with real-time session status polling

- All web app components updated for consistency with new UI library

## [6.41.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- Tab system: open multiple files simultaneously, click tabs to switch, close tabs with unsaved changes warning, modified indicator dot on tabs
- Quick Open (Cmd/Ctrl+P): fuzzy file search modal -- type to filter, Enter to open, Escape to close
- Preview auto-refresh: saving HTML/CSS/JS files automatically reloads the preview iframe
- File tree flattening utility for quick open search index

## [6.40.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- Monaco Editor integration in ProjectWorkspace -- full VS Code-grade syntax highlighting for 17+ languages, bracket pair colorization, code folding, smooth scrolling
- Resizable split panes (react-resizable-panels) -- drag to resize file tree, editor, and preview panels independently
- File CRUD API endpoints: PUT (save/update), POST (create file), DELETE (delete file), POST directory (create folder) -- all with path traversal protection and atomic writes
- File create/delete from file tree sidebar (+ File, + Dir buttons, hover X to delete)
- Cmd/Ctrl+S keyboard shortcut to save files
- Unsaved changes indicator (purple dot) and Save button in editor header
- Unsaved changes warning on file switch and back navigation
- Session data auto-refresh after file CRUD operations

- Preview panel is now a resizable pane instead of fixed 50% width

## [6.39.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- URL-based project routing: `/project/:sessionId` URLs persist across refresh (React Router)
- Live preview server: `GET /api/sessions/:id/preview/:path` serves project files with correct MIME types, enabling HTML/CSS/JS preview in iframe
- ProjectPage component with lazy loading (code-split 8.4KB chunk)
- Line numbers in code viewer with hover highlighting
- File size and type display in code viewer header
- Scroll position resets when switching files
- Session state persistence: provider, active tab, current PRD survive page refresh via sessionStorage

### Changed
- Session history navigation uses URL (`/project/:id`) instead of in-memory state
- "View Project" button navigates to URL route instead of loading inline
- Preview iframe uses real URL (`/api/sessions/:id/preview/index.html`) instead of srcDoc, so relative CSS/JS/image assets load correctly

## [6.38.5] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- `loki web` start/stop/status lifecycle fully robust: start auto-kills orphaned processes blocking the port instead of erroring with "Port already in use"; stop kills processes by port when PID file is missing; status detects orphan processes via port check and shows their PID with cleanup instructions
- All `loki web` subcommands return exit code 0 on success (was returning 1 from lsof/rm failures under set -e)

## [6.38.4] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- Purple Lab: file content viewer now works for past sessions -- new `GET /api/sessions/{id}/file?path=` endpoint reads files from completed project directories with path traversal protection (previously only worked during active sessions, returning 400 for past builds)
- Purple Lab: ProjectWorkspace uses session-scoped file endpoint so clicking files in the file tree actually loads content
- Purple Lab: terminal output contained in fixed-height scrollable window (was growing infinitely, pushing page content down)
- Purple Lab: error boundaries wrap all monitoring panels -- component crashes show retry button instead of blanking entire app
- Purple Lab: session state persisted to sessionStorage -- page refresh during active build no longer flashes landing page
- Purple Lab: null guards on agent type and phase toLowerCase calls (fixes TypeError crash when agents have undefined type)

### Added
- ProjectWorkspace component: full IDE-like view with file tree sidebar, code viewer, and HTML preview iframe
- "View Project" primary CTA button after build completes -- opens ProjectWorkspace with file browser
- ErrorBoundary component with retry button for graceful crash recovery

## [6.38.3] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- Project Workspace: full-screen file browser and HTML preview panel after a build completes

- Auto-loads index.html preview on workspace open when present in project output

## [6.38.2] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- fix: auto-recreate /opt/homebrew/bin symlinks on macOS after Node version upgrade (postinstall)

## [6.38.1] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- CI failure: test_api_v2.py seed_project fixture and test_tenants.py backward-compat tests missing tenant_id (NOT NULL constraint added in v6.37.8)
- Removed stale backward-compatibility tests that tested tenant_id=None (behavior removed in v6.37.8); replaced with tests that verify tenant isolation

## [6.38.0] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- CI failure on Python 3.13: tests/test_runs.py fixtures missing tenant_id (NOT NULL constraint added in v6.37.8)

## [6.37.9] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- Web App: file browser TreeNode lazy-renders children in chunks of 100 with "show more" button, preventing browser freeze on directories with 1000+ files (#120)
- Dashboard: Project.tenant_id changed from nullable to non-nullable with DB constraint, preventing orphaned projects without a tenant (#112)
- Dashboard: cost calculations use round() to 6 decimal places (was 4), fixing float precision loss above ~$100K (#111)

- Dashboard: TaskCreate.title and ProjectCreate.name strip/reject control characters (#110)
- Dashboard: TaskMove validates status transitions via state machine, rejects invalid transitions with 422 (#95)

- Dashboard UI: log stream fetch and standalone requests include CORS credentials for remote/authenticated deployments (#107)
- Dashboard UI: session control buttons (pause/resume/stop) wait for API response before updating state, preventing false success display (#106)

## [6.37.2] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- Purple Lab: model tier display now uses actual RARV iteration mapping instead of heuristic model name matching (#140)
- Purple Lab: file content errors show specific error messages with retry button instead of generic text (#121)
- Purple Lab: removed stale hardcoded template fallback list, shows user warning when templates fail to load (#119)

### Security
- Dashboard: OIDC JWT authentication, PID race condition fix, WebSocket broadcast hardening (#144)

### Fixed
- CLI: `loki export json` and `loki export timeline` now check for jq upfront with a helpful install message instead of silently failing (#138)
- Events: `EventBus` now cleans up background threads on destruction via `__del__`, `close()`, and context manager support (#133)
- Events: processed event ID set is now pruned before disk write, preventing unbounded growth when disk writes fail (#132)
- Purple Lab: session detail regex now accepts project names with dots (e.g., `project-1.0`) (#136)
- Memory: `evaluate_thresholds()` now logs a warning when a threshold metric is missing instead of silently skipping it (#128)
- Purple Lab: API URLs no longer hardcoded to localhost -- derived from `window.location.origin` for remote deployments (#114)
- Purple Lab: WebSocket disconnect now clears stale state, forcing fallback to HTTP polling (#113)
- MCP: `validate_path()` now checks intermediate symlink targets in chain to prevent escapes through multi-hop symlinks (#131)
- MCP: `loki_start_project` PRD path now validated with `validate_path()` to prevent path traversal (#131)
- Memory: namespace validation uses allowlist (alphanumeric, hyphen, underscore) in `MemoryStorage`, `with_namespace()`, and `NamespaceManager` to block path traversal (#127)
- Memory: `_cleanup_stale_locks()` uses elapsed-time comparison instead of wall-clock datetime, preventing breakage on clock skew (#126)
- Dashboard: `broadcast()` iterates over `list(active_connections)` to prevent modification during iteration (#101)
- Dashboard: JSON reads from `.loki/` catch `OSError` alongside `JSONDecodeError` for concurrent write resilience (#88)

## [6.36.6] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- CI: `loki ci --pr --github-comment --format github` no longer fails with `unbound variable: report_timestamp_` -- trailing underscore typo fixed in `autonomy/loki` line 16742 (#145)

### Changed
- License transitioned from MIT to Business Source License 1.1 (BSL 1.1)
- Free for personal, internal, academic, and non-commercial use
- Commercial use that competes with Loki Mode requires a separate license from Autonomi, Inc.
- Each version automatically converts to Apache License 2.0 four years after release (Change Date: March 19, 2030)
- Updated license references across all distribution channels: package.json, vscode-extension, Python SDK (pyproject.toml), TypeScript SDK, README badge and section
- Added LICENSE-CHANGE-NOTICE.md explaining what changed and what is/isn't affected

## [6.36.5] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- Memory: `EpisodeCluster.to_dict()` now uses `getattr()` instead of `.get()` for EpisodeTrace dataclass instances in `memory/consolidation.py` (#134)
- MCP: module-level `_state_manager` and `_learning_collector` singletons are now cleaned up via `cleanup_mcp_singletons()` registered with `atexit`, preventing file handle leaks on server restart (#130)
- State: `VersionVector.concurrent_with()` now returns True for identical vectors, matching causality semantics where equal vectors represent independent events with the same knowledge (#129)
- Memory: numpy and sentence-transformers import failures now emit `logging.warning()` in `memory/retrieval.py` and `memory/engine.py` so users know why vector search is degraded (#125)
- Dashboard: `require_scope()` dependency returns `True` instead of `None` when auth is disabled, preventing FastAPI from treating the None return as a valid passthrough for `/api/control/*` endpoints (#87)

## [6.36.4] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- Purple Lab: CORS origins are now configurable via `PURPLE_LAB_CORS_ORIGINS` env var (comma-separated list), enabling remote and Docker deployments that were previously blocked by hardcoded localhost-only origins (#135)
- Purple Lab: path traversal protection now uses `Path.relative_to()` instead of `str.startswith()`, preventing the prefix-collision edge case where `/tmp/proj` would incorrectly match `/tmp/projother`; symlink chains that escape the project base are also rejected (#115)

## [6.36.3] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- Orchestrator reliability: initialize `file_count` before use to prevent unbound variable errors in run.sh (#66)
- Orchestrator reliability: add guards in `load_ledger_context` to handle missing or malformed ledger files gracefully (#62)
- Orchestrator reliability: PRD conflict resolution no longer overwrites user-specified PRD when a session already exists (#60)
- CLI safety: `require_jq` now returns exit code 1 on failure instead of silently continuing, preventing cascading errors in dependent commands (#57)
- CLI safety: `cmd_init` checks for an active session before initializing and exits cleanly if one exists (#70)
- CLI safety: `--ship` and `--pr` flags now validate git prerequisites (clean working tree, remote set) before proceeding (#69)
- Critical CLI fix: JSON validation runs before merge signal extraction to prevent crashes on malformed provider output (#56)
- Critical CLI fix: `handle_pause` return value is now captured and propagated correctly, preventing silent pause failures (#58)
- Critical CLI fix: `--provider` flag validation rejects unknown provider names with a clear error message instead of falling through to undefined behavior (#82)

## [6.36.2] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- Dashboard not refreshing in Claude Code sessions: `_get_loki_dir()` used relative `.loki/` path which resolved to the dashboard server's CWD (loki-mode install dir), not the project directory where `run.sh` writes state. Now resolves via LOKI_DIR env var -> CWD/.loki -> ~/.loki fallback chain.
- Dashboard WebSocket was passive (never pushed `.loki/` state). Added `_push_loki_state_loop()` background task that watches `dashboard-state.json` for changes and broadcasts `status_update` messages every 2s when running (30s idle), transforming raw state to StatusResponse-compatible format.
- Dashboard overview component now connects WebSocket on mount so server-push state updates are received in real-time (supplements existing 5s HTTP polling)

## [6.36.1] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- Session history now shows real status (not "Unknown") for past builds -- infers completed/started/in_progress/empty from project contents when session.json is absent
- Past builds in session history are clickable and open a read-only viewer with PRD preview, file tree, and session logs
- Cluster lifecycle hooks now expand `$LOKI_CLUSTER_*` env var references in hook commands -- previously `shell=False` passed literal `$LOKI_CLUSTER_NAME` to `echo` instead of the value (test-platform-infra.sh Test 7)
- Remove null byte from CHANGELOG.md that was causing GitHub to render it as binary

## [6.36.0] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- CRITICAL: Stop session now kills the entire process group (catches loki child processes), cancels the reader task, and closes stdout pipes -- previously only killed the parent process leaving orphaned children, leaked file descriptors, and accumulated background tasks across start/stop cycles
- CRITICAL: Race condition on concurrent start requests -- session state mutations now protected by asyncio.Lock preventing double-spawned loki processes
- CRITICAL: Replaced deprecated `asyncio.get_event_loop()` with `asyncio.get_running_loop()` across 6 call sites (Python 3.12+ compatibility)
- CRITICAL: UI screen flashing/blank during state transitions -- HTTP status poll now only runs when WebSocket is disconnected, eliminating stale data that caused `isRunning` to flip and unmount/remount the entire layout
- HIGH: `SessionState.reset()` did not cancel the reader task -- tasks accumulated across start/stop cycles causing memory leaks and open file descriptor exhaustion
- HIGH: `_broadcast()` iterated over mutable `ws_clients` set during send -- concurrent WebSocket disconnects could cause RuntimeError; now iterates over a copy
- HIGH: Stop handler in frontend silently swallowed all errors and unconditionally set `isRunning=false` -- now checks backend response and clears stale WebSocket state on stop
- HIGH: `StatusOverview` and `ControlBar` components returned `null` when status was null during transitions -- caused entire running layout to briefly unmount showing blank screen; now render placeholder values
- HIGH: WebSocket push_task not properly awaited on cancellation -- could leave tasks in undefined state; now awaited with CancelledError handling
- Subprocess now spawned with `start_new_session=True` for clean process group kill on stop

### Added
- `/health` endpoint for load balancer and orchestrator health checks
- WebSocket disconnect indicator already visible in header (verified working)

## [6.35.1] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- Python CI test failure: moved `pytest_plugins` from `tests/docker/conftest.py` to top-level `conftest.py` to comply with pytest requirements for non-top-level conftest files
- Added `pytest.ini` to exclude Docker integration tests from default test run (they require a live server and are meant for Docker CI only)
- All 483 Python unit tests now pass across Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13

## [6.35.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added - Purple Lab CLI Feature Integration Complete
- loki plan: Pre-build estimate panel -- shows complexity, cost, iterations, time before confirming start
- loki report: Post-build report generation -- HTML/Markdown shareable reports with full session analysis
- loki share: One-click GitHub Gist sharing from report panel
- Provider panel: Provider switching in UI (Claude, Codex, Gemini) with state unified in Header

- Session history: Browse past builds when idle, organized by date with PRD snippet and status
- loki onboard: In-app repository analysis (generates CLAUDE.md from existing code)
- Security: Path traversal protection on onboard endpoint, 1MB PRD size cap on plan/start
- Product: Provider selector unified to single source of truth (Header), all buttons labeled intuitively
- Testing: All 8 features validated via 3-round UAT (Security, Product, Integration reviewers)
- All 23 existing E2E tests still pass (docker compose, local pytest)

## [6.34.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added - Purple Lab GTM Feature Complete
- ControlBar: Stop, Pause, and Resume buttons now visible during active sessions (previously read-only status bar)
- PRDInput: Optional project directory field -- type a path or leave blank to auto-create under ~/purple-lab-projects/
- FileBrowser: File content viewer -- click any file in the tree to view it inline with syntax highlighting
- Terminal: Scroll lock toggle (Live/Locked) -- auto-scrolls to latest output when Live, freezes when Locked so you can read
- Running state: PRD summary banner shows first 60 chars of what is being built
- CLI: loki web --prd path/to/prd.md pre-fills the PRD textarea from a file
- Server: GET /api/session/prd-prefill, POST /api/session/pause, POST /api/session/resume endpoints
- 23 E2E tests pass (docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --abort-on-container-exit)

## [6.33.1] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Fix `loki metrics` version display (was hardcoded to v6.32.0 instead of reading runtime version)
- Pass `LOKI_SKILL_DIR` env var to metrics Python heredoc for proper version detection

## [6.33.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- `loki watch [prd-path]` command: auto-rerun on PRD file changes
  - Monitors a PRD file and automatically re-runs `loki start` when the file is saved
  - Enables a tight edit-PRD-see-results development loop
  - Auto-detects PRD files: prd.md, PRD.md, or first *.md in current directory
  - Native filesystem watching: fswatch (macOS), inotifywait (Linux), stat polling fallback
  - `--once` flag: run once immediately then exit
  - `--interval N` flag: poll interval in seconds for fallback watcher (default: 2)
  - `--no-auto-start` flag: watch but do not auto-start, just print change timestamps
  - `--debounce N` flag: wait N seconds after change before triggering (default: 3)
  - Graceful shutdown: Ctrl+C stops any running loki session and exits cleanly
  - Shell completions updated for bash

### Tests
- New test suite: tests/test-watch-command.sh (12 tests)

## [6.32.1] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- postinstall: detect when npm global bin dir is not in PATH and print clear fix instructions
- Fixes "command not found: loki" for users with Homebrew-managed Node.js (affects npm prefix pointing to keg dir)
- Also suggests Homebrew tap as alternative install method

## [6.32.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- `loki metrics` command: session productivity reporter that analyzes past Loki Mode sessions
  - Reads `.loki/` session data (orchestrator state, queue, efficiency metrics, memory)
  - Aggregates stats: iterations completed, agents deployed, tasks completed, success rate
  - Git integration: lines added/removed, commits, files changed, tests written
  - Time saved estimate: total_iterations x 15min per iteration
  - ASCII stats card output -- screenshot-worthy formatted report
  - `--json` flag for machine-readable output
  - `--last N` flag to analyze only the last N sessions
  - `--save` flag writes METRICS.md to project root
  - `--share` flag uploads report as GitHub Gist
  - `prometheus` subcommand preserves legacy Prometheus/OpenMetrics dashboard fetch
  - Shell completions updated for bash and zsh

### Tests
- New test suite: tests/test-metrics-command.sh (12 tests)

## [6.31.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- `loki explain [path]` command: analyze any codebase and generate a plain-English architectural explanation
  - Executive summary, architecture overview, technology stack, key patterns, getting started, and contributor guide
  - Auto-detects language, framework, build system, test framework, CI/CD, and architecture patterns
  - Supports --json for machine-readable output, --brief for condensed one-pager, --save to write EXPLAIN.md
  - Works on any repository (JS/TS, Python, Go, Rust, Ruby, Java/Kotlin, C/C++)
  - Detects monorepos (Lerna, Turborepo, Nx, pnpm/npm workspaces)
  - Identifies patterns: REST, GraphQL, gRPC, tRPC, WebSocket, MVC, event-driven, middleware, and more

## [6.30.3] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Purple Lab: eliminated network connection explosion (was 27+ unique TCP connections per session)
  - Server: added timeout_keep_alive=30 to uvicorn so connections are reused
  - Server: WebSocket now pushes state_update bundles (status + agents + logs) every 2s when running, 30s when idle -- eliminates 3 of 6 polling loops entirely
  - Frontend: removed usePolling for status, agents, logs -- these now come from WebSocket push
  - Frontend: kept 30s HTTP fallback for status (safety net when WS is down)
  - Frontend: memory, checklist, files still poll at 30s (rarely change, not worth pushing)
- Net result: idle = 1 WS connection + 0 HTTP polls; running = 1 WS connection + 3 slow HTTP polls every 30s

## [6.30.2] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Purple Lab: Start Build button appeared to do nothing after click -- POST /api/session/start returned 200 but UI stayed on PRD screen because isRunning state only updated on next poll cycle (up to 30s in idle). Now immediately transitions to running view on successful start response.
- Stop button now immediately transitions back to PRD/idle view on success.
- PRDInput onSubmit prop typed as Promise<void> to ensure await works correctly in component.

## [6.30.1] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Purple Lab: stop polling all API endpoints when idle -- status now polls every 30s (was 2s) when no session running; agents/logs/memory/checklist/files polling pauses entirely until session starts. Eliminates 57+ unnecessary network requests visible in browser devtools.

## [6.30.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- `loki share` command: upload session reports as shareable GitHub Gists in one command
- Supports `--private` flag for secret gists (default: public)
- Supports `--format text|markdown|html` flag (default: markdown)
- Graceful fallback when gh CLI is missing or not authenticated
- Shell completions updated for bash and zsh

### Tests
- New test suite: tests/test-share-command.sh (8 tests)

## [6.29.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- BMAD story priority ordering by MVP/phase label: stories from MVP epics are queued first, then Phase 2, then Phase 3
- Auto-write-back to sprint-status.yml and epics.md checkboxes when stories are completed
- New CLI flags: --write-back, --completed-story, --completed-stories-file for bmad-adapter.py
- Priority fields (priority, priority_weight) added to parsed epic and story data

### Changed
- parse_epics() now extracts phase labels from Epic List section and headings
- run.sh BMAD queue population sorts stories by priority_weight before queuing
- track_iteration_complete() triggers bmad_write_back() after successful iterations

## [6.28.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- `loki init` project scaffolding: creates project directory, prd.md from template, .loki/ config, README.md, and git init
- Expanded template gallery from 13 to 22 templates (added ai-chatbot, api-only, blog-platform, e-commerce, full-stack-demo, rest-api-auth, saas-starter, simple-todo-app, static-landing-page)
- New flags: --template/-t TYPE, --no-git, --stdout, --dry-run
- Template categories: Simple, Standard, Complex

## [6.27.2] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Purple Lab: tighten CORS from wildcard (*) to localhost only (127.0.0.1:57375 and localhost:57375)
- Added full Docker Compose E2E test harness (tests/docker/, docker-compose.test.yml) -- 20/20 tests pass

## [6.27.1] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Purple Lab (loki web): web-app/server.py was missing from npm package -- loki web failed with "server not found" error on any npm install
- Added web-app/server.py to package.json files array

## [6.27.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- `loki report` command -- session report generator with text, markdown, and HTML output formats
- Report reads .loki/ session data (autonomy state, quality gates, agents, queue, council, events)
- Flags: `--format text|markdown|html`, `--output <file>`, `--no-gates`, `--no-agents`, `--no-timeline`
- HTML output uses dark theme with inline CSS (no external deps), highlights pass/fail status
- Graceful empty state when .loki/ directory has no data
- 10 tests in tests/test-report-command.sh

### Changed
- Separated Purple Lab (web-app/) from Loki Dashboard (dashboard/) -- they are now fully independent products
- Dashboard server (port 57374) no longer serves web-app files; only serves dashboard-ui/dist/ and dashboard/static/
- Purple Lab server (port 57375) runs standalone via web-app/server.py with no dashboard dependency
- `loki web` starts web-app/server.py directly (not dashboard/server.py)
- PRD Input is the landing hero -- full-width on first load, dashboard panels shown only after session starts
- Start Build actually POSTs to /api/session/start and launches a real loki subprocess
- Stop button wired to /api/session/stop
- Branding updated to Purple Lab throughout (title, header, copy)
- Fixed asyncio.iscoroutinefunction deprecation in server.py
- Validated: security review APPROVED, E2E tests 9/9 PASS, path traversal blocked

## [6.26.6] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- web-app/dist/ now committed to git and included in npm package -- root .gitignore had `dist/` which excluded it from the repo, so CI never had the built files to publish
## [6.26.5] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- npm package actually includes web-app/dist/ now -- replaced `**/dist/` npmignore pattern (which blocked all dist dirs including web-app) with specific exclusions for dashboard-ui/dist/ and vscode-extension/dist/ only

## [6.26.4] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- npm package now actually includes web-app/dist/ -- .npmignore had `**/dist/` which excluded it despite package.json files array including it

## [6.26.3] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Security: path traversal vulnerability in SPA catch-all route -- now uses realpath() + containment check (found by review council)
- Dashboard empty states: quality gates and PRD checklist panels now show clear actionable messages instead of appearing broken when no session has run

## [6.26.2] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Dashboard no longer stops when loki session finishes -- persists for post-session analysis, metrics, and browsing
- Dashboard no longer crashes when idle -- removed orphan watchdog that killed the server when no active session was detected
- Dashboard returns clean "idle" status when no .loki/ directory exists instead of crashing

## [6.26.1] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- `loki web` now works correctly: web app is served by the dashboard FastAPI server on port 57374 instead of a separate static file server that could not proxy API calls
- Added web-app/dist/ to npm package files so the web app is included in global installs
- Web app SPA catch-all route serves index.html for client-side routing

## [6.26.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- `loki web` CLI command: serves the web app, auto-starts dashboard API, opens browser
  - Subcommands: start (default), stop, status. Options: --port, --no-open, --no-api
- Web App: File Browser with recursive tree view, expand/collapse, file content preview
- Web App: Memory Viewer with episodic/semantic/skills stat cards, token usage progress bar
- Web App: Quality Gates Panel with 9-gate status display, progress bar, expandable details
- API client: `/api/files` and `/api/files/content` endpoints for file tree browsing
- App layout: 4-section dashboard with bottom row for File Browser and Memory Viewer
- Production build: 223KB JS (68KB gzipped) + 16KB CSS (4KB gzipped) -- 10 components total

## [6.25.2] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- `--json` flag for programmatic JSON output
- `--efficiency` flag for per-iteration token and cost breakdown
- Graceful handling of missing data files (shows N/A for unavailable metrics)

## [6.17.1] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Added visibility into inter-iteration gap: users now see log messages during quality gates (static analysis, test coverage, code review) and completion council check between RARV iterations. Previously the terminal was silent for minutes between "[Session complete]" and the next iteration start, causing confusion about whether execution was stuck.

## [6.17.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- `loki trigger` command: event-driven autonomous execution (analogous to Cursor Automations)
- `autonomy/trigger-server.py`: GitHub webhook receiver (issues, pull_request, workflow_run events)

## [6.16.1] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Dashboard Python compatibility: added `from __future__ import annotations` to 14 dashboard files that used Python 3.10+ type union syntax (`X | None`) and Python 3.9+ built-in generics (`dict[str, Any]`). Dashboard now works on Python 3.8+ as documented.

## [6.16.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- Dashboard memory browser: FTS5 full-text search with collection filtering and result display
- Dashboard memory browser: storage backend stats showing backend type, entry counts, database size, FTS5 status
- Dashboard: quality gates and RARV timeline components now wired into standalone dashboard pages
- Dashboard bundle: 6 previously unexported components now registered and available (quality-gates, rarv-timeline, run-manager, audit-viewer, api-keys, tenant-switcher)

## [6.15.1] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- BMAD adapter path resolution broken for global npm installs -- resolve_script_path now used instead of dirname "$0" fallback which resolved to bin/ symlink directory
- BMAD sprint-status.yml now read and parsed -- completed/done stories are skipped when populating the task queue, preventing re-implementation of already-completed work

## [6.15.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **SQLite + FTS5 memory storage**: New primary storage backend with full-text search. Factory auto-selects SQLite when available, falls back to JSON storage. Located in `memory/sqlite_storage.py`.
- **Auto RARV capture**: Cleaned up duplicate `store_episode_trace` calls in the autonomous loop for cleaner episode recording.
- **3 MCP memory tools**: Added `mem_search`, `mem_timeline`, and `mem_get` tools to `mcp/server.py` for programmatic memory access.
- **Dashboard memory endpoints**: New `/api/memory/search` and `/api/memory/stats` endpoints plus 5 existing endpoints upgraded to use SQLite backend.

## [6.14.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **`loki review <dir>` command**: Standalone quality gate runner for any project directory. Runs 6 gates: project-type detection, lint, tests, security, dependencies, and structure. Supports `--json` and `--verbose` flags. No AI provider needed. Works as a CI/CD step.
- **GitHub Action (`review`)**: New reusable action at `.github/actions/review/action.yml` -- enables `loki review` in any GitHub Actions workflow.

## [6.13.1] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **simple-todo-app.md**: Added project structure, database schema, API endpoints, testing section, and success criteria to pass quality audit
- **api-only.md**: Added project structure, data model, expanded testing section, and added success criteria
- **e-commerce.md**: Removed undocumented 'reviews' from features (no schema/API supported it)
- **full-stack-demo.md**: Expanded project structure, made tests required instead of optional, added acceptance criteria

## [6.13.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **`loki demo` rewrite**: Replaced simulated/fake demo with real execution that runs `loki start` on a bundled template. Supports `--dir`, `--provider`, `--dry-run` flags. Shows project summary and offers to open result in browser.

## [6.12.5] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- **`loki remote` bypass permissions**: Added `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` to `claude remote-control` invocations so spawned remote sessions can actually use Read, Write, and Bash tools. Without this, Loki Mode was blocked from operating in remote sessions.

## [6.12.4] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- **`loki remote` auto-trust via config**: Previous approach (piping `/exit` to `claude`) could not interact with the TUI trust dialog. Now writes `hasTrustDialogAccepted: true` directly to `~/.claude.json` projects config, which is the actual trust storage used by Claude Code. Uses `os.path.realpath()` to handle macOS symlinks (`/tmp` -> `/private/tmp`).

## [6.12.3] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- **`loki remote` zero-friction trust**: Auto-trust workspace by piping `/exit` to `claude` instead of requiring manual interaction. Fully automatic recovery from untrusted workspace errors.

## [6.12.2] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- **`loki remote` trust auto-recovery**: Fixed `set -euo pipefail` causing script to exit before auto-recovery could trigger on workspace trust errors. Now uses `|| rc_exit=$?` pattern to capture exit code safely.

## [6.12.1] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- **`loki remote` trust auto-recovery**: On workspace trust failure, automatically opens interactive Claude for trust acceptance, then retries remote-control seamlessly

## [6.12.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- **OpenSpec Bridge** (`loki start --openspec PATH`): Spec-driven development input pathway
  - Reads OpenSpec change directories (proposal.md, specs/, tasks.md, design.md)
  - Normalizes to Loki-native formats (PRD, task queue, delta context)
  - Supports ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED delta specs for brownfield development
  - Complexity classification (simple/standard/complex/enterprise)
  - Scenario-based verification mapping (GIVEN/WHEN/THEN)
  - Mutual exclusivity with --bmad-project flag
  - Warning on all-completed task lists
  - Delta context injection in agent prompts

### Fixed
- **`loki remote` auto-trust**: Automatically trusts workspace via `claude -p` before launching remote-control, eliminating manual trust step
- **OpenSpec adapter parser**: Fixed "Previously" annotation extraction for inline format, fixed "Deprecated" reason extraction for narrative descriptions
- **CLI adapter invocation**: Fixed adapter running with --validate only (never generating output files)

### New Files
- `autonomy/openspec-adapter.py` -- Stdlib-only Python adapter (~480 lines)
- `skills/openspec-integration.md` -- Delta-aware development skill module
- `tests/test_openspec_adapter.py` -- 28 unit tests
- `examples/openspec/` -- 6 test fixtures

## [6.11.3] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- **`loki remote` auto-recovery**: When workspace isn't trusted, automatically opens interactive Claude Code for trust acceptance, then retries remote-control -- zero manual steps needed

## [6.11.1] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- **`loki remote` workspace trust error**: Replaced `exec` with normal invocation so troubleshooting guidance is shown when `claude remote-control` fails (e.g., untrusted workspace, not logged in)

## [6.11.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- **OpenSpec Bridge** (`loki start --openspec PATH`): New input pathway for spec-driven development
  - Reads OpenSpec change directories (proposal.md, specs/, tasks.md, design.md)
  - Normalizes to Loki-native formats (PRD, task queue, delta context)
  - Supports ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED delta specs for brownfield development
  - Complexity classification (simple/standard/complex/enterprise)
  - Scenario-based verification mapping (GIVEN/WHEN/THEN)
  - Follows BMAD adapter pattern (CLI flag -> validation -> adapter -> queue bridge)

### New Files
- `autonomy/openspec-adapter.py` - Stdlib-only Python adapter (~480 lines)
- `skills/openspec-integration.md` - Delta-aware development skill module
- `tests/test_openspec_adapter.py` - 28 unit tests for adapter
- `examples/openspec/` - 6 test fixtures (simple, standard, complex, brownfield, partial, malformed)

### Changed
- Mutual exclusivity check for `--openspec` and `--bmad-project` flags
- Warning when all OpenSpec tasks are already completed
- Delta context injection in agent prompts (ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED awareness)
- OpenSpec task queue bridge (parallel to BMAD queue bridge)

## [6.10.0] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed
- Done signals safety valve: agent signaling "done" repeatedly now force-stops after 10 total signals (env: `LOKI_COUNCIL_DONE_SIGNAL_LIMIT`)
- Arithmetic error in completion council: sanitize `grep -ciE` output before arithmetic to prevent bash errors
- PRD scope misclassification: expanded header regex to match 16 section types (module, component, epic, etc.) plus word-count fallback for large PRDs
- Monorepo test runner detection: scan workspace packages for vitest/jest when root package.json has no test runner
- Auto-derive completion promise from PRD: sets promise and switches perpetual->checkpoint mode for PRD-driven work (env: `LOKI_AUTO_COMPLETION_PROMISE`, `LOKI_FORCE_PERPETUAL`)
- Code review gate escalation ladder: auto-clear at 3 failures, escalate at 5, PAUSE at 10 consecutive failures (env: `LOKI_GATE_CLEAR_LIMIT`, `LOKI_GATE_ESCALATE_LIMIT`, `LOKI_GATE_PAUSE_LIMIT`)

## [6.9.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- Dashboard task detail modal: click any task to view story, acceptance criteria, context files, and full specification
- Dashboard checkpoint enrichment: checkpoints now show iteration number, provider, phase, git branch, and file count
- Task markdown parser in dashboard API: extracts structured data from queue markdown files (metadata, spec, criteria, context)

### Fixed
- Path traversal hardening: checkpoint listing now validates IDs with `_SAFE_ID_RE` before filesystem access
- XSS hardening: all dynamic values in task board kanban cards now escaped via `_escapeHtml()`
- Removed dead code: unused `PRIORITY_COLORS` constant, redundant `import re`

### Changed
- Checkpoint API normalizes field names from run.sh format (ts/sha/task/iter) to frontend format (created_at/git_sha/message/iteration)

## [6.8.1] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed
- OTEL spans: use custom Span class directly in spans.js instead of tracer (real SDK returns incompatible span objects breaking parent-child hierarchy, status codes, and unique spanId generation)
- `loki provider models` source attribution: single-model providers (aider, cline) no longer falsely report generic tier env vars as source

## [6.8.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- Dynamic model configuration: all providers use env var override chains instead of hardcoded model strings
- Claude provider uses aliases (`opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`) that auto-resolve to latest versions via Claude CLI
- 3-tier env var precedence: provider-specific (`LOKI_CLAUDE_MODEL_PLANNING`) > generic (`LOKI_MODEL_PLANNING`) > default
- `loki provider models` diagnostic command showing resolved model config with source attribution
- `parse_simple_yaml()` now supports `model.planning`, `model.development`, `model.fast` config keys
- Codex/Gemini/Aider/Cline providers support env var overrides (`LOKI_CODEX_MODEL`, `LOKI_GEMINI_MODEL_*`, etc.)

### Changed
- Claude provider stores aliases instead of full model IDs (e.g., `opus` not `claude-opus-4-6`)
- Pricing labels use generic names (`Opus (latest)` instead of `Opus 4.6`)
- Removed all `sed` model-string extraction from `get_provider_tier_param()` and `provider_invoke_with_tier()`
- Aider/Cline providers keep full model strings as last-resort defaults (litellm/own routing needs them)
- All hardcoded model references in `autonomy/run.sh` now chain through provider config variables

## [6.7.1] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- Vector search: use python3.12 (not system python3.14) for ML packages (sentence-transformers, numpy)
- Vector search: wire `loki memory search` to actual `MemoryRetrieval.retrieve_by_similarity()` API
- Quality gates: `mkdir -p` for signals directory in `enforce_static_analysis()` and `enforce_test_coverage()`
- Parallel worktree: bash 5 `set -u` unbound variable for empty associative arrays (`declare -A WORKTREE_PIDS=()`)
- Parallel worktree: guard PID lookup with `+x` existence check to prevent unbound errors

## [6.7.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- Hard quality gates: `enforce_static_analysis()` and `enforce_test_coverage()` in orchestrator, controlled by `LOKI_HARD_GATES` env var
- `loki audit lint` and `loki audit test` CLI commands for on-demand quality checks
- Gate failure injection into `build_prompt()` so LLM self-corrects on next iteration

- `loki agent list|info|run|start|review` for 41 agent type dispatch across 8 swarms
- `agents/types.json` with structured agent definitions (engineering, operations, business, data, product, growth, review, orchestration)
- Agent types wired into `run_code_review()` specialist selection via `LOKI_AGENTS_TYPES_FILE`
- `loki memory vectors setup` with Python 3.12 auto-detection for ML package compatibility
- `loki memory search` for keyword-based memory retrieval
- `loki telemetry status|enable|disable` for OpenTelemetry management
- OTEL real SDK integration (`@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node`) with graceful fallback to custom OTLP exporter
- Doctor integrations section: MCP SDK, numpy, sentence-transformers, ChromaDB, OTEL checks
- Comprehensive E2E test suite: 67 tests across 10 sections (tests/test-e2e-features.sh)

### Fixed
- `loki provider show <name>` now correctly forwards arguments (was ignoring provider name)
- Aider default model updated from deprecated `claude-3.7-sonnet` to `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`
- Worktree clean command: fixed subshell variable scope bug (pipeline counter)
- Agent info Python injection concern: switched to env var passing
- Removed duplicate function definitions (enforce_static_analysis, enforce_test_coverage) that created dead code
- Test suite fixes: removed tautological env var tests, fixed subshell counter bugs

## [6.6.1] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- Degraded providers (aider/codex/gemini) now get simplified prompts that small models can process
- Completion council integer expression error from grep -c output handling
- Aider stdin blocking risk (added < /dev/null to invocation helpers)

## [6.6.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- Cline CLI provider (Tier 2 - near-full capabilities with subagents and MCP)
- Aider provider (Tier 3 - 18+ model provider support via OpenRouter, Ollama, etc.)
- `--cline-model`, `--aider-model`, `--aider-flags` CLI options
- Provider support in dashboard, sandbox, council-v2, and doctor commands

### Fixed
- Doctor command no longer aborts on first warning (set -e safety)

- `loki provider show` now accepts positional argument
- Provider list, doctor JSON, and skill setup include all 5 providers

## [6.5.0] - 2026-02-28

### Security Fixes
- **CRITICAL: Command injection in swarm hooks** - `swarm/patterns.py` used `shell=True` with untrusted hook strings; replaced with `shlex.split()` + `shell=False`
- **HIGH: Shell injection via issue title** - `loki run` nohup detached mode interpolated `$title` inside `bash -c` string; replaced with temp script file + environment variables
- **HIGH: Path traversal in dashboard** - `get_episode`/`get_skill` endpoints lacked path validation; added `realpath()` + prefix check
- **CRITICAL: bash 3.2 incompatibility** - `declare -A` in `sandbox.sh` and `declare -g` in `migration-hooks.sh` required bash 4+; replaced with function lookups and `printf -v`

### Fixed

- **UTC conversion** - `_to_utc_isoformat` now actually converts non-UTC timezone-aware datetimes
- **MCP server** - `loki_start_project` PRD path validation no longer rejects valid paths
- **MCP server** - `MemoryEngine` no longer receives string as `storage` parameter
- **MCP server** - Pattern IDs now include UUID suffix to prevent sub-second collisions
- **Swarm scoring** - `_score_candidate` load_factor uses diminishing returns (never reaches zero)

## [6.3.1] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed
- Rebuild dashboard frontend (missed in v6.3.0 release workflow)
- Ran Opus feedback loop to verify all 17 v6.3.0 feature claims (all verified)
- Ran Playwright E2E tests (9 passed)
- Add conftest.py to legacy-checkout-app fixture to exclude from root pytest collection

## [6.3.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added

#### Track A: Migration Engine V2 Hardening
- **Deterministic migration hooks engine** (`autonomy/hooks/migration-hooks.sh`)
  - `hook_post_file_edit`: runs tests after every file change, blocks and rolls back on failure
  - `hook_post_step`: validates step completion claims mechanically
  - `hook_pre_phase_gate`: blocks phase transitions if requirements not met
  - `hook_on_agent_stop`: prevents premature victory if features still failing
  - Hooks are shell scripts. Agent cannot override them.
  - YAML config via `.loki/migration-hooks.yaml` (safe read/declare, no eval)
- **JSON schema validation** for migration artifacts (`schemas/`)

## [5.49.1] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- Central PID registry at `.loki/pids/` with JSON entries for all spawned processes
- 6 registry functions: `init_pid_registry`, `register_pid`, `unregister_pid`, `kill_registered_pid`, `cleanup_orphan_pids`, `kill_all_registered`
- `_parse_json_field` helper with python3 + shell (sed) fallback for environments without python3
- `loki cleanup` CLI command to kill orphaned processes from crashed sessions
- Startup orphan scan: automatically detects and kills orphans from previous sessions
- Background mode and parallel mode PIDs now registered in PID registry
- Quality Gate #8: Mock Detector (`tests/detect-mock-problems.sh`) - detects tests that only test inline mocks
- Quality Gate #9: Test Mutation Detector (`tests/detect-test-mutations.sh`) - detects low assertion density
- Process Supervisor test suite (`tests/test-process-supervisor.sh`) - 26 tests
- Dashboard `/api/health/processes` endpoint reads PID registry for process status

### Fixed

## [5.9.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added - Cross-Project Learning

**New feature: Learn from past sessions across all your projects.**

Cross-project learnings automatically extract patterns, mistakes, and successes from every Loki Mode session and make them available for future sessions.

#### New CLI Commands
- `loki memory list` - View summary of all cross-project learnings
- `loki memory show <type>` - View patterns, mistakes, or successes
- `loki memory search <query>` - Search across all learnings
- `loki memory stats` - View statistics by project and category
- `loki memory export <file>` - Export learnings to JSON
- `loki memory clear <type>` - Clear specific learning type

#### New API Endpoints
- `GET /memory` - Summary of all learnings (patterns, mistakes, successes counts)
- `GET /memory/:type` - Get learnings by type with pagination
- `GET /memory/search?q=` - Search across all learnings
- `GET /memory/stats` - Statistics by project and category
- `DELETE /memory/:type` - Clear specific learning type

#### Dashboard Integration
- New "Cross-Project Learnings" card in the dashboard
- Real-time updates showing patterns, mistakes, and successes counts
- Visual progress bars for each learning type

#### Storage
- Learnings stored in `~/.loki/learnings/` (global, not project-specific)
- JSONL format for efficient append-only storage
- MD5 hash-based deduplication prevents duplicate entries
- Automatic extraction from CONTINUITY.md at session end

#### How It Works
1. At the end of each session, Loki Mode extracts learnings from CONTINUITY.md
2. Patterns are extracted from "Patterns Used", "Solutions Applied", "Key Approaches"
3. Mistakes are extracted from "Challenges Encountered", "Mistakes Made"
4. Successes are extracted from "Completed Tasks", completed checkboxes `[x]`
5. Entries are deduplicated using MD5 hashes before storage

## [5.8.7] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed - Session retry persistence bug

**Bug fix: New sessions were failing immediately due to persisted retry count.**

#### Fixed
- **Retry count reset**: New sessions now automatically reset retry count when previous session ended in failure (status: failed, max_retries_exceeded, max_iterations_reached)
- **New `loki reset` command**: Added command to manually reset session state
  - `loki reset` - Reset all state (autonomy + failed queue)
  - `loki reset retries` - Reset only retry counter
  - `loki reset failed` - Clear failed task queue

#### Root Cause
The `autonomy-state.json` persisted `retryCount: 50` from a failed session. New sessions would load this and immediately exit with "Max retries exceeded" without doing any work.

---

## [5.8.6] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed - Critical: run.sh deletion bug

**Critical fix: Background mode was deleting run.sh from npm installation.**

#### Bug Fix
- **Root cause**: When starting background mode, `LOKI_RUNNING_FROM_TEMP` was exported to the child process, causing it to skip self-copy and run directly from the original file. The exit trap then deleted the original run.sh instead of the temp copy.
- **Fix**: Unset `LOKI_RUNNING_FROM_TEMP` before starting the nohup background process
- **Impact**: `loki status` and `loki stop` would fail with "Could not find Loki Mode installation" after running `loki start --bg`

---

## [5.8.5] - 2026-02-01

### Changed - CLI UX

**Patch release: Improved CLI user experience based on feedback.**

#### UX Improvements
- **`loki start --help`**: Added help flag support with detailed usage info
- **Provider capability indicator**: Shows "full features" vs "degraded mode" status
- **Smarter stop/pause**: Now checks if session is running before sending signals
- **Better resume messaging**: Clearer feedback about session state
- **CLI installation warning**: `loki provider set` warns if CLI not installed

#### Example Output
```
$ loki provider show
Provider: codex
Status:   Degraded mode (sequential only)

$ loki stop
No active session running.
Start a session with: loki start
```

---

## [5.8.4] - 2026-02-01

### Added - Provider Persistence

**Minor release: Provider selection now persists across runs for each codebase.**

#### Provider Management
- **Persistent provider**: Once you select a provider (claude/codex/gemini), it saves to `.loki/state/provider`
- **Auto-load on start**: `loki start` automatically loads the saved provider for the codebase
- **Provider display**: `loki start` and `loki status` now show current provider with switch instructions
- **New `loki provider` command**: Full provider management CLI
  - `loki provider show` - Display current provider
  - `loki provider set <name>` - Switch to a different provider
  - `loki provider list` - List available providers with install status
  - `loki provider info <name>` - Show detailed provider info

#### Example Output
```
$ loki status
Provider: claude (full features)
  Switch: loki provider set codex|gemini
```

---

## [5.8.3] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed - Bash Compatibility

**Patch release: Fix parallel mode bash version compatibility on macOS.**

#### Bash Compatibility
- **Parallel mode fallback**: Gracefully fall back to sequential mode when bash < 4.0
- **Proper version check**: Check bash version before entering parallel mode, not during execution
- **Unbound variable fix**: Prevent "testing: unbound variable" errors in bash 3.x
- **macOS support**: Users on macOS with default bash 3.2 now get automatic sequential mode fallback

#### New Release Tools
- **scripts/release.sh**: Automated release script for version bumping and publishing
- **scripts/update-changelog.sh**: Auto-generate changelog from conventional commits

---
## [5.8.2] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed - API Status Bug

**Patch release: Fix misleading API status when session not running.**

#### Fixed
- **API status fix**: Return 'idle' instead of stale 'failed'/'completed' when no process is running
- **Added lastSessionResult field**: Debug info showing what the last session's exit status was
- **Version sync**: Fixed root package.json version sync with VS Code extension

This fixes the issue where `loki api status` would show `"status": "failed"` even when the API server was healthy but no session was active.

---

## [4.2.0] - 2026-01-22

### Added - Foundational Principles and Priority Order

**Minor release: Constitutional improvements inspired by Anthropic's soul spec and production learnings.**

#### Foundational Principles (CONSTITUTION.md)
Five principles explaining WHY each autonomy rule exists:
1. **Autonomy Preserves Momentum** - Questions create blocking dependencies; decide and verify instead
2. **Memory Matters More Than Reasoning** - Context retrieval is the bottleneck, not intelligence
3. **Verification Builds Trust** - Trust through observable, repeatable evidence, not intentions
4. **Atomicity Enables Recovery** - Checkpoints allow rollback to known-good states
5. **Constraints Enable Speed** - Quality gates catch problems when they're cheap to fix

#### Priority Order for Conflict Resolution
When rules conflict, resolve by hierarchy:
1. Safety (don't break production)
2. Correctness (tests pass, specs match)
3. Quality (reviews passed, maintainable)
4. Speed (autonomy, parallelization)

#### Memory > Reasoning Insight (memory-system.md)
Prominent documentation of the core insight: "Your Agent's Reasoning Is Fine - Its Memory Isn't"
- Production problems solved by better context retrieval, not reasoning
- Memory architecture is the competitive advantage
- Episodic-to-semantic consolidation is not optional

#### Research Attribution
- [Anthropic Claude Constitution](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-new-constitution) - principled reasoning over rigid rules

## [3.0.0] - 2026-01-18

### Major Release - Progressive Disclosure Architecture ("Thin Skill")

**Complete rewrite of SKILL.md from 1350+ lines to ~120 lines core with on-demand module loading.**

#### Why This Matters
- **Context Preservation**: Original 1350-line SKILL.md consumed 10-15% of Claude's context window before any work began
- **Research-Backed**: 12gramsofcarbon.com analysis found most skills are "slop" at 150+ lines; recommended <150 lines always-on
- **Production-Tested**: HN 2025 patterns confirm "less is more" for agent context
- **Code-Only Principle**: rijnard.com pattern - produce executable code witnesses, not verbose descriptions

#### Architecture

**Before (v2.x):**
```
SKILL.md (1350 lines) -> Always loaded -> 10-15% context consumed
```

**After (v3.0):**
```
SKILL.md (~120 lines)     # Always loaded: core essentials only
skills/00-index.md        # Module routing table
skills/{module}.md        # Loaded on-demand (1-3 at a time)
```

#### New Structure
```
skills/
  00-index.md          # Module selection rules + routing
  model-selection.md   # Task tool, parallelization, thinking modes
  quality-gates.md     # 7-gate system, velocity-quality balance
  testing.md           # Playwright, E2E, property-based testing
  production.md        # HN patterns, CI/CD, context management
  troubleshooting.md   # Issues, red flags, fallbacks
  agents.md            # 37 agent types, structured prompting
  artifacts.md         # Generation, code transformation
  patterns-advanced.md # OptiMind, k8s-valkey, Constitutional AI
```

#### Usage
1. Read `skills/00-index.md` at task start
2. Load only 1-3 relevant modules for current task
3. Execute with focused context
4. Unload modules when task changes

#### Research Sources Integrated
- [12gramsofcarbon.com](https://12gramsofcarbon.com/p/your-agent-skills-are-all-slop) - Skill size limits
- [rijnard.com](https://rijnard.com/blog/the-code-only-agent) - Code-only agent pattern
- [platform.claude.com/docs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows) - Context window management
- [Claude Code --agents flag](https://claude.ai/code) - Custom agent definitions via JSON

#### Breaking Changes
- SKILL.md no longer contains detailed patterns (moved to modules)
- Must read `skills/00-index.md` to find detailed content
- Behavior remains identical, only loading strategy changed

---

## [2.37.1] - 2026-01-18

### Fixed - Direct SQLite Sync for Vibe Kanban

**Replaced JSON file export with direct SQLite database writes for seamless Vibe Kanban integration.**

#### Problem Solved
- Previous setup wrote JSON files to `~/.vibe-kanban/loki-tasks/` which Vibe Kanban doesn't read
- Vibe Kanban reads from its SQLite database at `~/Library/Application Support/ai.bloop.vibe-kanban/db.sqlite`
- Now writes directly to SQLite, eliminating the disconnect

#### New Script
- **`scripts/sync-to-vibe-kanban.sh`**: Single script that handles everything
  - Auto-detects project name from current directory
  - Cross-platform support (macOS and Linux)
  - Creates project in Vibe Kanban if not exists
  - Uses `[Loki]` prefix for task identification (safe delete/recreate)
  - Maps statuses: pending->todo, in-progress->inprogress, completed->done, failed->cancelled

#### Usage
```bash
# Run from any project directory with .loki folder
cd ~/git/your-project
~/.claude/skills/loki-mode/scripts/sync-to-vibe-kanban.sh

# Or use the watcher for automatic sync
~/.claude/skills/loki-mode/scripts/vibe-sync-watcher.sh
```

#### Updated
- `scripts/vibe-sync-watcher.sh` now uses `sync-to-vibe-kanban.sh` instead of JSON export

---

## [2.37.0] - 2026-01-18

### Fixed - Vibe Kanban Integration Issues

**Resolved critical issues in Vibe Kanban export integration with comprehensive security and quality improvements.**

#### Security Fixes
- **Command Injection Vulnerability**: Fixed command injection vulnerability in `scripts/vibe-sync-watcher.sh:90` by replacing `find -exec md5sum` with safe `find -print0 | xargs -0 md5sum` pattern
- **File Permissions**: Ensured safe file handling in polling mode

#### Fixed
- **AttributeError in Export Script**: Fixed `scripts/export-to-vibe-kanban.sh:115` to handle both dict and string payloads using `isinstance()` check
- **Race Condition**: Changed `inotifywait -e modify` to `-e close_write` in watcher script to wait for complete file writes before triggering export
- **Error Handling**: Added error checks at all 4 locations where export script is called in watcher, displaying warnings on failure
- **Debug Logging**: Added warning when `orchestrator.json` is not found to help diagnose configuration issues

#### Code Quality
- **Reduced Duplication**: Extracted duplicate payload handling code into helper functions (`get_payload_title()`, `get_payload_description()`) eliminating 20+ lines of duplication
- **Shellcheck Compliance**: All scripts pass shellcheck validation

#### Added
- **Watcher Script**: Created `scripts/vibe-sync-watcher.sh` for automatic task syncing with cross-platform support (fswatch/inotifywait/polling fallback)
- **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive test suite `tests/test-vibe-kanban-export.sh` with 6 test cases covering:
  - Dict payload handling with action/description/command fields
  - String payload handling with fallback to 'Task' title
  - Priority mapping (high >=8, medium >=5, low <5)
  - Status mapping (pending->todo, in-progress->doing, completed->done, failed->blocked)
  - Summary file creation with current phase
  - Missing orchestrator.json warning display

#### Documentation
- **Integration Guide**: Enhanced `integrations/vibe-kanban.md` with step-by-step instructions, troubleshooting section, and realistic expectations about manual export workflow
- **README Updates**: Clarified Vibe Kanban integration requirements in main README

#### Technical Details
- Watcher supports three modes: fswatch (macOS), inotifywait (Linux), and polling fallback (BSD/universal)
- Color-coded logging for better visibility (green=success, yellow=warning, red=error)
- Graceful degradation when file watching tools unavailable
- Cross-platform compatibility tested on macOS and Linux environments

**Related**: Fixes #8 | PR #9

## [2.36.11] - 2026-01-17

### Added - External Research Integration (Velocity-Quality, OptiMind, k8s-valkey-operator)

**Analyzed three external sources and integrated key patterns into SKILL.md.**

#### Research Sources Analyzed

| Source | Key Findings |
|--------|--------------|
| [arXiv 2511.04427v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04427) | LLM agents: 281% velocity gains are TRANSIENT, 30% warnings + 41% complexity are PERSISTENT |
| [Microsoft OptiMind](https://ai.azure.com/catalog/models/microsoft-optimind-sft) | Problem classification, domain expert hints, ensemble solution generation |
| [k8s-valkey-operator](https://github.com/smoketurner/k8s-valkey-operator) | Formal state machines, idempotent operations, Kubernetes reconciliation patterns |

#### Changed Made

1. **Velocity-Quality Feedback Loop (CRITICAL)** (New Section)
   - Documented the arXiv finding: 3.28x complexity OR 4.94x warnings cancels ALL velocity gains
   - Added mandatory quality checks per task (static analysis, complexity, coverage)
   - Zero tolerance threshold for new warnings

2. **Problem Classification with Expert Hints** (New Section - OptiMind Pattern)
   - Categories: crud_operations, authentication, database_operations, frontend_components, infrastructure
   - Domain-specific hints and common errors per category
   - Enables targeted guidance before implementation

3. **Ensemble Solution Generation** (New Section - OptiMind Pattern)
   - Generate multiple solutions for complex tasks
   - Select by consensus or feedback-based ranking
   - When to use: architecture decisions, optimization problems

4. **Formal State Machines** (New Section - k8s-valkey-operator Pattern)
   - Explicit SDLC phase state machine with defined transitions
   - Idempotent operations pattern (safe under retry)
   - State invariants for each phase

5. **Essential Patterns Updated**
   - Added: Quality Over Velocity, Problem Classification, Ensemble Solutions, Idempotent Operations, Formal State Machines

#### Key Insight

The arXiv research provides empirical evidence for why Loki Mode's quality gates are critical: without them, velocity gains are completely negated by accumulated technical debt.

---

## [2.36.10] - 2026-01-17

### Added - Anthropic Best Practices Integration

**Validated SKILL.md against Anthropic's official guidance and added genuine improvements.**

#### Research Sources Analyzed

| Source | Key Findings |
|--------|--------------|
| [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents) | 5 workflow patterns, simplicity emphasis |
| [Claude Code Best Practices](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices) | Explore-Plan-Code, thinking modes, TDD |
| [Enterprise AI Transformation](https://claude.com/blog/driving-ai-transformation-with-claude) | Bottleneck targeting, quality focus |

#### Changed Made

1. **Simplicity First Principle** (Essential Patterns)
   - Added: "Start simple. Only escalate complexity when simpler approaches fail."
   - Rationale: Anthropic emphasizes "most successful implementations use simple, composable patterns"

2. **TDD Workflow** (Essential Patterns)
   - Added: `Write failing tests -> Implement to pass -> Refactor`
   - Rationale: Anthropic recommends test-first development as primary workflow

3. **Extended Thinking Mode** (New Section)
   - Added guidance for "think", "think hard", "ultrathink" prefixes
   - When to use for Discovery, Architecture, and critical decisions
   - When NOT to use (Haiku tasks, obvious implementations)

4. **Visual Design Input** (New Section)
   - Added workflow for consuming design mockups and screenshots
   - Integration with Discovery and Development phases
   - Combines with Playwright for visual regression

#### Already Aligned (Validated)

These patterns were already correctly implemented:
- Explore-Plan-Code workflow
- Confidence-based routing
- Parallelization with Haiku
- Multi-Claude workflows with git worktrees
- Context management and proactive compaction
- One Feature at a Time rule

---

## [2.36.9] - 2026-01-17

### Added - MCP Integration Reference with Parallel AI

**Created `references/mcp-integration.md` documenting recommended MCP servers for Loki Mode.**

#### Parallel AI Integration

Added Parallel AI as recommended MCP server for enhanced web research:

| Capability | Benefit for Loki Mode |
|------------|----------------------|
| Deep Research API | 48% accuracy on complex research (vs native LLM search) |
| Evidence-based results | Provenance for every output - aligns with quality gates |
| Monitor API | Track dependency updates, security advisories, competitor changes |
| Task API | Structured research with custom schemas |

**SDLC Phases Enhanced:** Discovery, Web Research, Continuous Monitoring

#### Also Documented

- Playwright MCP for E2E testing (existing)
- MCP configuration locations
- Usage patterns in Loki Mode agents
- Evaluation criteria for new MCP servers

---

## [2.36.8] - 2026-01-17

### Changed - SDLC Phase-Based Model Assignment

**Updated model selection strategy to assign models by SDLC phase rather than task type.**

#### Previous Model Assignment
| Model | Use For |
|-------|---------|
| Opus 4.5 | Planning only - architecture & high-level decisions |
| Sonnet 4.5 | Development - implementation & functional testing |
| Haiku 4.5 | Operations - simple tasks & monitoring |

#### New Model Assignment (SDLC Phase-Based)
| Model | SDLC Phases | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Opus 4.5** | Bootstrap, Discovery, Architecture, Development | PRD analysis, system design, feature implementation, API endpoints, complex bug fixes |
| **Sonnet 4.5** | QA, Deployment | Integration/E2E tests, security scanning, performance testing, deployment automation |
| **Haiku 4.5** | All other operations (in parallel) | Unit tests, docs, bash commands, linting, monitoring, health checks |

#### Rationale
- **Opus for Development**: Higher quality code generation for core implementation work
- **Sonnet for QA/Deployment**: Cost-effective for testing and deployment automation
- **Haiku in parallel**: Maximum parallelization for operations tasks

#### Files Modified
- `SKILL.md`: Updated Model Selection Strategy section (lines 163-210)
- `SKILL.md`: Updated Quick Reference line 21
- `SKILL.md`: Updated Dynamic Agent Selection table
- `docs/COMPARISON.md`: Added Zencoder comparison section, updated version history

---

## [2.36.7] - 2026-01-17

### Added - Zencoder/Zenflow CI/CD Automation Patterns

**Comprehensive analysis of Zencoder.ai (Zenflow, Zen Agents, Zentester) identified 3 genuine gaps that have been adopted.**

#### Zencoder Features Analyzed

| Feature | Zencoder | Loki Mode | Assessment |
|---------|----------|-----------|------------|
| Four Pillars | Structured Workflows, SDD, Multi-Agent Verification, Parallel Execution | SDLC + RARV + 7 Gates + Worktrees | TIE |
| Spec-Driven Development | Specs as first-class objects | OpenAPI-first | TIE |
| Multi-Agent Verification | Model diversity (Claude vs OpenAI, 54% improvement) | 3 blind reviewers + devil's advocate | Different (N/A for Claude Code) |
| Quality Gates | Built-in verification loops | 7 explicit gates + anti-sycophancy | Loki Mode |
| Memory System | Not documented | 3-tier episodic/semantic/procedural | Loki Mode |
| Agent Specialization | Custom Zen Agents | 37 pre-defined specialized | Loki Mode |
| CI Failure Analysis | Explicit pattern with auto-fix | DevOps agent only | **ADOPTED** |
| Review Comment Resolution | Auto-apply simple changes | Manual review | **ADOPTED** |
| Dependency Management | Scheduled PRs, one group at a time | Mentioned only | **ADOPTED** |
| Multi-Repo Support | Full cross-repo | Single repo | Zencoder (N/A for Claude Code) |

#### Patterns ADOPTED from Zencoder (HIGH Priority)

**1. CI Failure Analysis and Auto-Resolution:**
- Analyze cryptic CI logs automatically
- Classify failure type: regression vs flakiness vs environment vs dependency
- Auto-fix 90% of flaky tests
- Reduce time-to-green by 50%

**2. Automated Review Comment Resolution:**
- Auto-apply straightforward review comments
- Categories: input validation, missing tests, error messages, small refactoring, documentation
- Skip: architecture changes, API modifications, security-sensitive code
- Commit with "fix: address review comments (auto-applied)"

**3. Continuous Dependency Management:**
- Schedule: weekly or bi-weekly scans
- Strategy: one dependency group at a time
- Prioritize: security > major > minor > patch
- Keep PRs small (1-3 packages per PR)
- Track upgrade history in semantic memory

#### Patterns NOT Adopted (with justification)

| Pattern | Zencoder | Why Not Adopted |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Model Diversity | Claude critiques OpenAI code | Claude Code only has Claude models |
| Multi-Repo Support | Cross-repo changes | Claude Code is single-context |
| IDE Plugins | VS Code, JetBrains | Loki Mode is a skill, not a plugin |
| Repo Grokking | Proprietary indexing | Claude Code has native exploration |

#### Where Loki Mode Remains SUPERIOR

1. **Quality Control**: 7 gates + blind review + devil's advocate vs built-in loops

## [2.36.6] - 2026-01-17

### Validated - 2026 Research Resources (RLM, Token-Aware Planning, Claude Code Patterns)

**Comprehensive validation of 8 external resources against Loki Mode v2.36.5. All patterns already implemented or not applicable.**

#### Resources Analyzed

| Resource | Key Patterns | Assessment |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| **arXiv 2512.24601 (RLM)** | Python REPL context, recursive self-invocation, 10M+ token handling | Different use case - extreme context scenarios, not Claude Code workflows |
| **ysz/recursive-llm** | Depth-bound recursion, async parallelization, two-model optimization | Already covered via sub-agent architecture + parallel Haiku agents |
| **Token-aware planning** | Context rot (<256k effective), sub-agent isolation, compaction | Already comprehensive (SKILL.md:880-920, run.sh compaction) |
| **davila7/claude-code-templates** | 100+ agents, semantic validator, hooks with matchers | Loki has 37 specialized agents (better organization), guardrails, hooks |
| **pguso/agents-from-scratch** | "Agents are loops, state, constraints" | Educational - Loki Mode IS the production implementation |
| **Boris Cherny Tips (Jan 2026)** | 5 Claudes parallel, Opus thinking, ~42hr sessions, hooks | All present: 10+ Haiku parallel, model tiering, CONTINUITY.md |
| **Inner/outer loop bottleneck** | AI dev creates CI/CD bottleneck | Loki Mode IS the solution - automated quality gates |
| **azidan/codemap** | Symbol-to-line-range mapping, hash staleness, 60-80% token savings | Complementary MCP tool, not a pattern to implement |

#### Key Findings

**1. Recursive Language Models (MIT, Dec 2025):**
- Handles 10M+ tokens via Python REPL context storage
- Two-model optimization (expensive root, cheap branches)
- Assessment: Specialized for extreme context, not typical Claude Code workflows
- Loki Mode's CONTINUITY.md + compaction + sub-agents already sufficient

**2. Token-Aware Planning / Context Engineering:**
- Context rot phenomenon: effective window <256k even with 1M limit
- Sub-agent architectures with clean context windows
- ADK compaction triggers at configurable thresholds
- Assessment: Already implemented (COMPACTION_INTERVAL=25, sub-agent isolation)

**3. Claude Code Templates (davila7):**
- 100+ agents, 159+ commands, semantic/reference validators
- Proper hook specifications with tool matchers
- Assessment: Loki has superior architecture (37 specialized vs generic templates)

**4. CodeMap (azidan):**
- Symbol-to-line-range precision reduces tokens 60-80%
- Per-directory distributed indexing
- Hash-based staleness detection
- Assessment: Complementary MCP tool for I/O optimization, not core pattern

#### Patterns Already Present in Loki Mode

| External Pattern | Loki Mode Implementation |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Parallel execution (5 Claudes) | 10+ Haiku agents in parallel (SKILL.md:21) |
| Model tiering | Opus/Sonnet/Haiku with explicit categories (SKILL.md:163-244) |
| Background agents | run_in_background parameter (SKILL.md:247-267) |
| Context compaction | COMPACTION_INTERVAL=25 (run.sh:140) |
| Sub-agent isolation | Fresh context per sub-task (SKILL.md:920-928) |
| Hooks system | Event-driven hooks (SKILL.md:758-792) |
| CI/CD automation | 7 quality gates, deterministic outer loops (SKILL.md:540-558) |

#### Conclusion

**No updates needed.** Loki Mode v2.36.5 implements a superset of all analyzed patterns. Resources validated existing architecture rather than identifying gaps.

## [2.36.5] - 2026-01-15

### Added - Antigravity/Amazon Q Comparison and Transformation Patterns

**Deep comparison with Google Antigravity (Gemini 3, 76.2% SWE-bench) and Amazon Q Developer (66% SWE-bench) validated by Opus feedback loop.**

#### Google Antigravity Features Analyzed

| Feature | Antigravity | Loki Mode | Assessment |
|---------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Manager Surface | Interactive agent control | Monitoring dashboard | Different purpose (human vs autonomous) |
| Artifacts System | Screenshots, video, diagrams | Traces, tests | Enhanced: Artifact generation added |
| Browser Subagents | Full recording, DOM capture | Playwright MCP | Equivalent + screenshots |
| Outcome Verification | Trust artifacts | 7 quality gates | Loki Mode superior |
| Knowledge Base | Simple snippets | 3-tier memory | Loki Mode superior |
| Multi-Model | Gemini 3, Claude, GPT-OSS | Opus/Sonnet/Haiku | Both multi-model |

#### Amazon Q Developer Features Analyzed

| Feature | Amazon Q | Loki Mode | Assessment |
|---------|----------|-----------|------------|
| SWE-Bench | 66% verified | Uses Claude | Framework, not model |
| Code Transformation | /transform (Java, SQL, .NET) | Not present | **ADOPTED** |
| MCP Support | Full protocol | Playwright MCP | Equivalent |
| Model Routing | Bedrock | 4-tier confidence | Loki Mode superior |
| CLI Agent | Fast local | run.sh wrapper | Equivalent |

#### Patterns ADOPTED (HIGH/MEDIUM Priority)

**1. Code Transformation Agent (Amazon Q):**
- Dedicated workflows for legacy modernization
- Language upgrades (Java 8->21, Python 2->3, Node 16->22)
- Database migrations (Oracle->PostgreSQL, MySQL->PostgreSQL)
- Framework modernization (Angular->React, .NET Framework->.NET Core)

**2. Artifact Generation (Antigravity):**
- Auto-generate verifiable deliverables
- Triggers: on_phase_complete, on_feature_complete, on_deployment
- Types: verification_report, architecture_diff, screenshot_gallery
- "Outcome verification" instead of "line-by-line auditing"

#### Patterns NOT Adopted (with justification)

| Pattern | Source | Why Not Adopted |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Manager Surface (interactive) | Antigravity | Requires human control, violates zero-intervention |
| Video Recording | Antigravity | Requires human review |
| Interactive Agent Spawning | Antigravity | Violates autonomous design |

#### Where Loki Mode is SUPERIOR

1. **Memory System**: 3-tier (episodic/semantic/procedural) vs simple snippets
2. **Quality Control**: 7 gates + blind review + devil's advocate vs artifact trust
3. **Model Routing**: 4-tier confidence + complexity matrix vs basic routing
4. **Autonomy**: Zero human intervention by design vs human orchestration

| Sandbox | seccomp + landlock isolation | Claude Code environment | Different platforms |
| $skill-creator | Interactive wizard | N/A | Not needed (autonomous) |

#### AWS Kiro Features Analyzed

| Feature | Kiro | Loki Mode | Assessment |
|---------|------|-----------|------------|
| Spec Files | requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md | OpenAPI-first | Both valid approaches |
| Agent Steering | .kiro/steering/ | CLAUDE.md + CONTINUITY.md + memory | Already more comprehensive |
| Property-Based Testing | Extract from specs, random inputs | None | **ADOPTED** |
| Hooks System | Event-driven automation | Phase-boundary only | **ADOPTED** |
| Review Learning | Build knowledge from feedback | Memory system exists but not connected | **ADOPTED** |
| Autonomous Agent | Frontier Agent, multi-repo | Single product focus | Different use case |

#### Patterns ADOPTED from Kiro (HIGH Priority)

**1. Property-Based Testing:**
- Auto-extract properties from OpenAPI schema constraints
- Run hundreds of random inputs with fast-check/hypothesis
- Verify invariants: email format, price >= 0, timestamps ordered
- Phase: QA, after unit tests, before integration

**2. Event-Driven Hooks:**
- Trigger on file write, task complete, phase complete
- Catches issues 5-10x earlier than phase-end review
- Examples: lint on save, typecheck on save, secrets scan

**3. Review-to-Memory Learning:**
- Pipe review findings (Critical/High/Medium) into semantic memory
- Convert to anti-patterns with prevention strategies
- Query anti-patterns before new implementations
- Continuous improvement loop

#### Patterns NOT Adopted (with justification)

| Pattern | Source | Why Not Adopted |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Progressive Skill Disclosure | Codex | Already implicit in references/ structure |
| Multi-Level Precedence | Codex | Solves multi-developer problem (irrelevant) |
| Agent Steering Files | Kiro | CLAUDE.md + memory already covers |
| $skill-creator | Codex | Humans create skills beforehand |
| Multi-Repository Agent | Kiro | Not aligned with single-product use case |

#### Where Loki Mode is SUPERIOR

1. **Zero Human Intervention**: Neither Codex nor Kiro designed for this
2. **Memory Depth**: 3-tier (episodic/semantic/procedural) vs none/basic
3. **Constitutional AI + Devil's Advocate**: Unique anti-sycophancy
4. **Full SDLC**: 37 agents vs coding-only focus
5. **Efficiency Metrics**: ToolOrchestra-inspired tracking

**See `docs/COMPARISON.md` for full competitive analysis.**

## [2.36.3] - 2026-01-15

### Added - Cursor/Devin Comparison and Parallel Development Patterns

**Deep comparison with Cursor 2.0 ($10B valuation, 500M ARR) and Devin 2.0 ($4B valuation) validated by Opus feedback loop.**

#### Cursor 2.0 Features Analyzed

| Feature | Cursor | Loki Mode | Assessment |
|---------|--------|-----------|------------|
| Multi-Agent Parallel | 8 agents with worktree isolation | Sequential (was restricted) | ADOPTED: Worktree isolation |
| Composer Model | Proprietary 250 tok/s | Uses Claude | Different architecture |
| BugBot PR Review | GitHub integration | Pre-commit review | Loki Mode superior (prevent vs detect) |
| Memories | Flat fact storage | 3-tier structured | Loki Mode superior |
| YOLO Mode | Auto-apply with allowlist | Full autonomous | Already more comprehensive |
| Tool Call Limits | 25 ops before approval | Guardrails/tripwires | Different approach (autonomous) |

#### Devin 2.0 Features Analyzed

| Feature | Devin | Loki Mode | Assessment |
|---------|-------|-----------|------------|
| Task Dispatch | One agent dispatches to others | 37 agents in 7 swarms | Loki Mode more comprehensive |
| Confidence Clarification | Asks user when unsure | Escalates to human | Both valid for different use cases |
| DeepWiki | Auto-generate docs | techwriter agent | Similar capability |
| Specialized Models | Kevin 32B for CUDA | Opus/Sonnet/Haiku tiering | Both optimize model selection |
| Sandbox Environment | Full shell/browser/editor | Claude Code environment | Different platforms |

#### Patterns ADOPTED from Cursor

**1. Git Worktree Isolation for Safe Parallel Development:**
- Enables up to 4 implementation agents in parallel
- Each agent works in isolated worktree (`.loki/worktrees/agent-{id}/`)
- Tests run in isolation, merge only on success
- Removes previous restriction: "NEVER dispatch multiple implementation subagents in parallel"

```yaml
workflow:
  1. git worktree add .loki/worktrees/agent-{id} -b agent-{id}-feature
  2. Agent implements in isolated directory
  3. Run tests within worktree
  4. Merge to main if tests pass
  5. Cleanup worktree and branch
```

**2. Atomic Checkpoint/Rollback:**
- Formalized checkpoint strategy before risky operations
- Git stash for instant rollback
- Clear recovery path on failure

#### Patterns NOT Adopted (with justification)

| Pattern | Source | Why Not Adopted |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Tool Call Limits (25 ops) | Cursor | Contradicts autonomous operation |
| BugBot GitHub Comments | Cursor | Pre-commit review is superior |
| Confidence-based Clarification | Devin | "NEVER ask questions" is core rule |
| VM Isolation | Cursor | Infrastructure cost, marginal benefit |

#### Where Loki Mode is SUPERIOR

1. **Memory System**: 3-tier (episodic/semantic/procedural) vs Cursor's flat facts
2. **Quality Control**: 7 gates + 3-reviewer blind + devil's advocate vs basic permissions
3. **Research Foundation**: 10+ papers vs proprietary undisclosed
4. **True Autonomy**: Zero human intervention vs semi-autonomous
5. **Full SDLC**: 37 agents covering business ops, not just coding

**See `docs/COMPARISON.md` for full competitive analysis.**

| Todo Continuation Enforcer | Oh-My-OpenCode | Already have superior wrapper enforcement |

#### Pattern ADOPTED: Proactive Context Management

**From Oh-My-OpenCode/Sisyphus pattern, validated by Opus:**

- Added `LOKI_COMPACTION_INTERVAL` env var (default: 25 iterations)
- Proactive compaction reminder injected into prompt every N iterations
- New "Proactive Context Management" section in SKILL.md
- Guidance on when/how to request context reset safely

```bash
# New environment variable
LOKI_COMPACTION_INTERVAL=25  # Suggest compaction every N iterations
```

#### Validation Process

1. Deep analysis of OpenCode docs, architecture, and Oh-My-OpenCode
2. Opus feedback loop for critical evaluation
3. Determined most OpenCode patterns are for interactive use (human-in-loop)
4. Loki Mode's autonomous patterns are architecturally superior for its use case
5. Only proactive compaction adopted as genuinely beneficial

**Audit Outcome: No Critical Features Missing**

Loki Mode already implements more comprehensive versions of:

| Feature | Loki Mode | Best External |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Agent Types | 37 specialized | Sisyphus: 11 |
| Memory System | Episodic/semantic/procedural + cross-project | Worldview: single-project |
| Recovery | RARV + circuit breakers + git checkpoints | Sisyphus: session recovery |
| Quality Gates | 7 gates + blind review + devil's advocate | None comparable |
| Enterprise Security | Audit logging, staged autonomy, path restrictions | Atom: BYOK |
| Benchmarks | 98.78% HumanEval, 99.67% SWE-bench | SETA: 46.5% Terminal-Bench |

**Potential additions evaluated but rejected:**
- LSP/AST integration (Sisyphus) - specialized feature, adds complexity without core value
- Knowledge graph (Atom) - complex infrastructure, overkill for CLI skill
- WAL-based storage (AgentFS) - over-engineering; git checkpoints serve same purpose

**Validation:**
- All existing tests pass (8/8 bootstrap, 8/8 task-queue)
- SKILL.md syntax valid
- run.sh functioning correctly
- Example PRDs available and documented

---

## [2.35.0] - 2026-01-08

### Added - Anthropic Agent Harness Patterns & Claude Agent SDK

**Sources:**
- [Effective Harnesses for Long-Running Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents) - Anthropic Engineering
- [Claude Agent SDK Overview](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview) - Anthropic Platform

**New Patterns:**

1. **One Feature at a Time** (Rule #7 in Core Autonomy)
   - Work on exactly one feature per iteration
   - Complete, commit, verify before moving to next
   - Prevents over-commitment and ensures clean progress tracking

2. **E2E Browser Testing with Playwright MCP**
   - Features NOT complete until verified via browser automation
   - New Essential Pattern: `Playwright MCP -> Automate browser -> Verify UI features visually`
   - Detailed verification flow added to SKILL.md
   - Note: Playwright cannot detect browser-native alert modals

3. **Advanced Task Tool Parameters**
   - `run_in_background`: Returns output_file path, output truncated to 30K chars
   - `resume`: Continue interrupted agents with full context
   - Use cases: Context limits, rate limits, multi-session work

### Fixed

- Release workflow: Use gh CLI instead of softprops action for atomic release creation

---

## [2.33.0] - 2026-01-08

### Added - AWS Bedrock Routing Mode Optimization

**Source:** [AWS Multi-Agent Orchestration Guidance](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/multi-agent-orchestration-on-aws/)

**New Pattern: Routing Mode Optimization**

Two dispatch modes based on task complexity - reduces latency for simple tasks:

| Mode | When to Use | Behavior |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Direct Routing** | Simple, single-domain tasks | Route directly to specialist agent, skip orchestration |
| **Supervisor Mode** | Complex, multi-step tasks | Full decomposition, coordination, result synthesis |

**Key Insights from AWS:**
- Simple tasks → Direct dispatch to Haiku (faster, minimal context)
- Complex tasks → Full supervisor orchestration (Sonnet coordination)
- Context depth varies by routing mode (avoid confusing simple agents with complex history)
- 10-agent limit per supervisor (validates our MAX_PARALLEL_AGENTS=10)

**Files Updated:**
- `SKILL.md` - Added Routing Mode pattern to Essential Patterns and new section with decision logic
- `ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md` - Added AWS Bedrock section with 4 source citations

---

## [2.32.1] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed - Critical Bug Fixes

**5 bugs fixed in autonomy/run.sh:**

| Bug | Symptom | Root Cause | Fix |
|-----|---------|------------|-----|
| Dashboard crash on edit | Dashboard killed mid-session | Bash reads scripts incrementally; editing corrupts execution | Self-copy to `/tmp/loki-run-PID.sh` before exec |
| Parse error: `name 'pattern' is not defined` | Python errors during PRD processing | PRD content with quotes breaking Python string literals | Pass context via `LOKI_CONTEXT` env var |
| `datetime.utcnow()` deprecated | DeprecationWarning spam in logs | Python 3.12+ deprecation | Use `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` |
| `log_warning: command not found` | Errors during resource monitoring | Function name mismatch (`log_warn` vs `log_warning`) | Added `log_warning()` as alias |
| CPU showing 45226498% | False resource warnings | Summed process CPU instead of system-wide | Parse idle% from `top` header |

**New Safeguards:**
- **Protected Files section** in SKILL.md - Documents files that shouldn't be edited during active sessions
- **Rule #6** in Core Autonomy Rules - "NEVER edit `autonomy/run.sh` while running"

### Added

## [2.18.5] - 2026-01-04

### Added
- **System Resource Monitoring** - Prevents computer overload from too many parallel agents (run.sh:786-899):
  - **Background Resource Monitor** checks CPU and memory usage every 5 minutes (configurable)
  - **Automatic Warnings** logged when CPU or memory exceeds thresholds (default: 80%)
  - **Resources JSON File** (`.loki/state/resources.json`) contains real-time resource status
  - **RARV Integration** - Claude checks resources.json during REASON step and throttles agents if needed
  - **macOS & Linux Support** - Platform-specific CPU/memory detection using `top`, `vm_stat`, `free`
  - **Configurable Thresholds** via environment variables:
    - `LOKI_RESOURCE_CHECK_INTERVAL` (default: 300 seconds = 5 minutes)
    - `LOKI_RESOURCE_CPU_THRESHOLD` (default: 80%)
    - `LOKI_RESOURCE_MEM_THRESHOLD` (default: 80%)

### Changed
- **RARV Cycle** - Updated REASON step to check `.loki/state/resources.json` for warnings (run.sh:1194)
  - If CPU or memory is high, Claude will reduce parallel agent spawning or pause non-critical tasks
  - Prevents system from becoming unusable due to too many agents
- **Cleanup Handlers** - `stop_status_monitor()` now also stops resource monitor (run.sh:335)

### Why This Matters
**User Problem:** "Loki Mode spinning agents made my computer unusable and I had to hard restart"
**Solution:** Resource monitoring prevents this by:
1. Continuously tracking CPU and memory usage every 5 minutes
2. Warning when thresholds are exceeded
3. Allowing Claude to self-throttle by reducing agent count
4. User can configure thresholds based on their hardware

### Impact
- **Prevents System Overload:** No more hard restarts due to too many parallel agents
- **Self-Regulating:** Claude automatically reduces agent spawning when resources are constrained
- **Transparent:** Resource status visible in `.loki/state/resources.json`
- **Configurable:** Users can set custom thresholds for their hardware
- **Cross-Platform:** Works on macOS and Linux
- **User Request:** Directly addresses "add capability to check cpu and memory every few mins and let claude take decision on it"

## [2.18.4] - 2026-01-04

### Changed
- **README.md Complete Restructure** - Transformed README to focus on value proposition and user experience:
  - **New Hero Section:** Clear tagline "The First Truly Autonomous Multi-Agent Startup System" with compelling value prop
  - **"Why Loki Mode?" Section:** Direct comparison table showing what others do vs. what Loki Mode does
  - **Core Advantages List:** 5 key differentiators (truly autonomous, massively parallel, production-ready, self-improving, zero babysitting)
  - **Dashboard & Real-Time Monitoring Section:** Dedicated section showcasing agent monitoring and task queue visualization with screenshot placeholders
  - **Autonomous Capabilities Section:** Prominent explanation of RARV cycle, perpetual improvement mode, and auto-resume/self-healing
  - **Simplified Quick Start:** 5-step getting started guide with clear "walk away" messaging
  - **Cleaner Installation:** Moved detailed installation steps to separate INSTALLATION.md
  - **Better Structure:** Logical flow from "what it is" → "why it's better" → "how to use it" → "how it works"

### Added
- **INSTALLATION.md** - Comprehensive installation guide with all platforms:
  - Table of contents for easy navigation
  - Quick install section (recommended approach)
  - Three installation options for Claude Code (git clone, releases, minimal curl)
  - Claude.ai web installation instructions
  - Anthropic API Console installation instructions
  - Verify installation section for all platforms
  - Troubleshooting section with common issues and solutions
  - Updating and uninstalling instructions

- **docs/screenshots/** - Screenshot directory with detailed instructions:
  - README.md explaining what screenshots to capture
  - Specifications for dashboard-agents.png and dashboard-tasks.png
  - Step-by-step instructions for creating screenshots
  - Alternative methods using test fixtures
  - Guidelines for professional, clean screenshots

### Impact

## [2.18.3] - 2026-01-04

### Changed
- **Clarified Agent Scaling Model** - Fixed misleading "37 agents" references across all documentation:
  - **README.md:** Badge changed to "Agent Types: 37", description now emphasizes dynamic scaling (few agents for simple projects, 100+ for complex startups)
  - **README.md:** Features table updated to "37 agent types across 6 swarms - dynamically spawned based on workload"
  - **README.md:** Comparison table changed "Agents: 37" → "Agent Types: 37 (dynamically spawned)" and added "Parallel Scaling" row
  - **README.md:** Vibe Kanban benefits changed from "all 37 agents" → "all active agents"
  - **SKILL.md:** Section header changed to "Agent Types (37 Specialized Types)" with clarification about dynamic spawning
  - **SKILL.md:** All swarm headers changed from "(X agents)" → "(X types)"
  - **SKILL.md:** Example updated from "37 parallel agents" → "100+ parallel agents"
  - **CONTEXT-EXPORT.md:** Updated to emphasize "37 specialized agent types" and dynamic scaling
  - **agents.md:** Header changed to "Agent Type Definitions" with note about dynamic spawning based on project needs
  - **integrations/vibe-kanban.md:** Changed "all 37 Loki agents" → "all active Loki agents"

### Why This Matters
The previous "37 agents" messaging was misleading because:
- **37 is the number of agent TYPES**, not the number of agents that spawn
- Loki Mode **dynamically spawns** only the agents needed for your specific project
- A simple todo app might use 5-10 agents total
- A complex startup could spawn 100+ agents working in parallel (multiple instances of the same type)
- The system is designed for **functionality-based scaling**, not fixed counts

### Impact
- **Clarity:** Eliminates confusion about how many agents will actually run
- **Realistic Expectations:** Users understand the system scales to their needs
- **Accuracy:** Documentation now reflects the actual dynamic agent spawning behavior
- **User Feedback:** Directly addresses user question about why docs mention "37 agents"

## [2.18.2] - 2026-01-04

### Added
- **Agent Monitoring Dashboard** - Real-time visibility into active agents (run.sh:330-735):
  - **Active Agents Section** with grid layout displaying all spawned agents
  - **Agent Cards** showing:
    - Agent ID and type (general-purpose, QA, DevOps, etc.)
    - Model badge with color coding (Sonnet = blue, Haiku = orange, Opus = purple)
    - Current status (active/completed)
    - Current work being performed
    - Runtime duration (e.g., "2h 15m")
    - Tasks completed count
  - **Active Agents Stat** in top stats bar
  - Auto-refreshes every 3 seconds alongside task queue
  - Responsive grid layout (adapts to screen size)

- **Agent State Aggregator** - Collects agent data for dashboard (run.sh:737-773):
  - `update_agents_state()` function aggregates `.agent/sub-agents/*.json` files
  - Writes to `.loki/state/agents.json` for dashboard consumption
  - Runs every 5 seconds via status monitor (run.sh:305, 311)
  - Handles missing directories gracefully (returns empty array)
  - Supports agent lineage schema from CONSTITUTION.md

### Changed
- **Dashboard Layout** - Reorganized for agent monitoring (run.sh:622-630):
  - Added "Active Agents" section header above agent grid
  - Added "Task Queue" section header above task columns
  - Reordered stats to show "Active Agents" first
  - Enhanced visual hierarchy with section separators

- **Status Monitor** - Now updates agent state alongside tasks (run.sh:300-319):
  - Calls `update_agents_state()` on startup
  - Updates agents.json every 5 seconds in background loop
  - Provides real-time agent tracking data for dashboard

### Impact
- **Visibility:** Real-time monitoring of all active agents, their models, and work
- **Performance Tracking:** See which agents are using which models (Haiku vs Sonnet vs Opus)
- **Debugging:** Quickly identify stuck agents or unbalanced workloads
- **Cost Awareness:** Visual indication of model usage (expensive Opus vs cheap Haiku)
- **User Request:** Directly addresses user's question "can you also have ability to see how many agents and their roles and work being done and their model?"

## [2.18.1] - 2026-01-04

### Fixed
- **Model Selection Hierarchy** - Corrected default model documentation (SKILL.md:83-91):
  - **Sonnet 4.5** is now clearly marked as **DEFAULT** for all standard implementation work
  - **Haiku 4.5** changed to **OPTIMIZATION ONLY** for simple/parallelizable tasks
  - **Opus 4.5** changed to **COMPLEX ONLY** for architecture & security
  - Previous documentation incorrectly suggested Haiku as default for most subagents
  - Aligns with best practices: Sonnet for quality, Haiku for speed optimization only

- **run.sh Implementation Gap** - RARV cycle now implemented in runner script (run.sh:870-871, 908-916):
  - Updated `rar_instruction` to `rarv_instruction` with full VERIFY step
  - Added "Mistakes & Learnings" reading in REASON step
  - Added self-verification loop: test → fail → capture error → update CONTINUITY.md → retry
  - Added git checkpoint rollback on verification failure
  - Mentions 2-3x quality improvement from self-verification
  - **CRITICAL FIX:** v2.18.0 documented RARV but run.sh still used old RAR cycle
  - run.sh now aligns with SKILL.md patterns

### Impact
- **Clarity:** Eliminates confusion about which model to use by default
- **Consistency:** run.sh now implements what SKILL.md documents
- **Quality:** Self-verification loop now active in production runs (not just documentation)
- **Real-World Testing:** Fixes gap identified during actual project usage

## [2.18.0] - 2026-01-04

### Added
- **Self-Updating Learning System** - Agents learn from mistakes automatically (SKILL.md:253-278):
  - "Mistakes & Learnings" section in CONTINUITY.md template
  - Error → Learning → Prevention pattern
  - Self-update protocol: capture error, analyze root cause, write learning, retry
  - Example format with timestamp, agent ID, what failed, why, how to prevent
  - Prevents repeating same errors across agent spawns

- **Automatic Self-Verification Loop (RARV Cycle)** - 2-3x quality improvement (SKILL.md:178-229):
  - Enhanced RAR to RARV: Reason → Act → Reflect → **Verify**
  - VERIFY step runs automated tests after every change
  - Feedback loop: Test → Fail → Learn → Update CONTINUITY.md → Retry
  - Rollback to last good git checkpoint on verification failure
  - Achieves 2-3x quality improvement (Boris Cherny's observed result)
  - AI tests its own work automatically

- **Extended Thinking Mode Guidance** - For complex problems (SKILL.md:89-107):
  - Added "Thinking Mode" column to model selection table
  - Sonnet 4.5 with thinking for complex debugging, architecture
  - Opus 4.5 with thinking for system design, security reviews
  - When to use: architecture decisions, complex debugging, security analysis
  - When NOT to use: simple tasks (wastes time and tokens)

  - Essential Patterns: Added "Self-Verification Loop (Boris Cherny)"
  - Memory Hierarchy: Added CONSTITUTION.md, noted "Mistakes & Learnings"

- **Model Selection Table** - Added Thinking Mode column (SKILL.md:83-87):
  - Haiku: Not available
  - Sonnet: "Use for complex problems"
  - Opus: "Use for architecture"

### Inspired By
**Boris Cherny (Creator of Claude Code) - "Max Setup" Pattern:**
- Self-updating CLAUDE.md based on mistakes (we adapted to CONTINUITY.md)
- Let AI test its own work (2-3x quality improvement observed)
- Extended thinking mode for complex problems
- "Less prompting, more systems. Parallelize + standardize + verify."

### Impact
- **Quality Improvement:** 2-3x (from automatic self-verification loop)
- **Error Reduction:** Mistakes logged and prevented from repeating
- **Learning System:** Agents build institutional knowledge over time
- **Debugging Speed:** Extended thinking improves complex problem-solving

### Migration Notes

  - 5 core inviolable principles with enforcement logic
  - Agent behavioral contracts (orchestrator, engineering, QA, DevOps)
  - Quality gates as YAML configs (pre-commit blocking, post-implementation auto-fix)
  - Memory hierarchy (CONTINUITY.md → CONSTITUTION.md → CLAUDE.md → Ledgers → Agent context)
  - Context lineage schema with JSON structure
  - Git checkpoint protocol integration
  - Runtime invariants (TypeScript assertions)
  - Amendment process for constitution versioning

- **Visual Specification Aids** - Mermaid diagram generation requirement (SKILL.md:481-485, CONSTITUTION.md):
  - `.loki/specs/diagrams/` directory for Mermaid diagrams
  - Required for complex features (3+ steps, architecture changes, state machines, integrations)
  - Examples: authentication flows, system architecture, multi-step workflows
  - Prevents ambiguity in AI-to-AI communication

- **Machine-Readable Rules** - Structured artifacts over markdown (SKILL.md:2507-2511):

## [2.16.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- **Model Selection Strategy** - Performance and cost optimization (SKILL.md:78-119):
  - Comprehensive model selection table (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus)
  - Use Haiku 4.5 for simple tasks (tests, docs, commands, fixes)
  - Use Sonnet 4.5 for standard implementation (default)
  - Use Opus 4.5 for complex architecture/planning
  - Speed/cost comparison matrix
  - Haiku task categories checklist (10 common use cases)

- Consolidated severity matrices (removed duplicates, kept one authoritative version)

## [2.14.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- **Claude Code Best Practices** - Integrated patterns from "Claude Code in Action" course:

  **CLAUDE.md Generation:**
  - Comprehensive codebase summary generated on bootstrap
  - Included in EVERY Claude request for persistent context
  - Contains: project summary, architecture, key files, critical patterns
  - Auto-updated by agents on significant changes

  **Three Memory Levels:**
  1. **Project Memory**: `.loki/CONTINUITY.md` + `CLAUDE.md` (shared, committed)
  2. **Agent Memory**: `.loki/memory/ledgers/` (per-agent, not committed)
  3. **Global Memory**: `.loki/rules/` (permanent patterns, committed)

  **Plan Mode Pattern:**
  - Research phase (read-only, find all relevant files)
  - Planning phase (create detailed plan, NO code yet)
  - Review checkpoint (get approval before implementing)
  - Implementation phase (execute plan systematically)
  - Use for: multi-file refactoring, architecture decisions, complex features

  **Thinking Mode:**
  - Trigger with "Ultra think" prefix
  - Extended reasoning budget for complex logic
  - Use for: subtle bugs, performance optimization, security assessment, architectural trade-offs

- **Hooks System (Quality Gates)**:

  **Pre-Tool-Use Hooks** - Block execution (exit code 2):
  - Prevent writes to auto-generated files
  - Validate implementation matches spec before write
  - Example: `.loki/hooks/pre-write.sh`

  **Post-Tool-Use Hooks** - Auto-fix after execution:
  - Type checking (TypeScript/mypy) with auto-fix feedback
  - Auto-formatting (Prettier, Black, gofmt)
  - Update CLAUDE.md on architecture changes
  - Example: `.loki/hooks/post-write.sh`

  **Deduplication Hook** - Prevent AI slop:
  - Launches separate Claude instance to detect duplicates
  - Suggests existing functions to reuse
  - Example: `.loki/hooks/post-write-deduplicate.sh`

- **Problem-Solving Workflows**:

  **3-Step Pattern** (for non-trivial tasks):
  1. Identify & Analyze: Grep/Read relevant files, create mental model
  2. Request Planning: Describe feature, get implementation plan (NO CODE)
  3. Implement Plan: Execute systematically, test after each file

  **Test-Driven Development Pattern:**
  1. Context Gathering: Read code, understand patterns, review spec
  2. Test Design: Ask Claude to suggest tests based on spec
  3. Test Implementation: Implement tests → FAIL (red phase)
  4. Implementation: Write code to pass tests → GREEN → refactor

- **Performance Optimization Pattern**:
  - Profile critical paths (benchmarks, profiling tools)
  - Create todo list of optimization opportunities
  - Implement fixes systematically
  - Real example: Chalk library 3.9x throughput improvement

### Changed
- **Directory Structure** - Added:
  - `.loki/hooks/` - Pre/post tool-use hooks for quality gates
  - `.loki/plans/` - Implementation plans (Plan Mode output)

- **Bootstrap Script** - Creates hooks/ and plans/ directories

- **RAR Cycle** - Enhanced with Claude Code patterns:
  - REASON: Read CONTINUITY.md + CLAUDE.md
  - ACT: Use hooks for quality gates
  - REFLECT: Update CONTINUITY.md + CLAUDE.md

### Best Practices
1. **Build incrementally** - Plan mode for architecture, small steps for implementation
2. **Maintain context** - Update CLAUDE.md and CONTINUITY.md continuously
3. **Verify outputs** - Use hooks for automated quality checks
4. **Prevent duplicates** - Deduplication hooks before shipping
5. **Test first** - TDD workflow prevents regressions
6. **Think deeply** - Use "Ultra think" for complex decisions
7. **Block bad writes** - Pre-tool-use hooks enforce quality gates

**"Claude Code functions best as flexible assistant that grows with team needs through tool expansion rather than fixed functionality"**

## [2.13.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** - Specifications as source of truth BEFORE code:

  **Philosophy**: `Spec → Tests from Spec → Code to Satisfy Spec → Validation`

  - OpenAPI 3.1 specifications written FIRST (before architecture/code)
  - Spec is executable contract between frontend/backend
  - Prevents API drift and breaking changes
  - Enables parallel development (frontend mocks from spec)
  - Documentation auto-generated from spec (always accurate)

  **Workflow**:
  1. Parse PRD and extract API requirements
  2. Generate OpenAPI spec with all endpoints, schemas, error codes
  3. Validate spec with Spectral linter
  4. Generate TypeScript types, client SDK, server stubs, docs
  5. Implement contract tests BEFORE implementation
  6. Code implements ONLY what's in spec
  7. CI/CD validates implementation against spec

  **Spec Storage**: `.loki/specs/openapi.yaml`

  **Spec Precedence**: Spec > PRD, Spec > Code, Spec > Documentation

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration** - Standardized agent communication:

  **Architecture**:
  - Each swarm is an MCP server (engineering, operations, business, data, growth)
  - Orchestrator is MCP client consuming swarm servers
  - Standardized tool/resource exchange protocol
  - Composable, interoperable agents

  **Benefits**:
  1. **Composability**: Mix agents from different sources
  2. **Interoperability**: Work with GitHub Copilot, other AI assistants
  3. **Modularity**: Each swarm is independent, replaceable
  4. **Discoverability**: Listed in GitHub MCP Registry
  5. **Reusability**: Other teams can use Loki agents standalone

  **MCP Servers Implemented**:
  - `loki-engineering-swarm`: Frontend, backend, database, QA agents
    - Tools: implement-feature, run-tests, review-code, refactor-code
    - Resources: loki://engineering/state, loki://engineering/continuity
  - `loki-operations-swarm`: DevOps, security, monitoring agents
    - Tools: deploy-application, run-security-scan, setup-monitoring
  - `loki-business-swarm`: Marketing, sales, legal agents
    - Tools: create-marketing-campaign, generate-sales-materials

  **External MCP Integration**:
  - GitHub MCP (create PRs, manage issues)
  - Playwright MCP (browser automation, E2E tests)
  - Notion MCP (knowledge base, documentation)

  **MCP Directory**: `.loki/mcp/` with servers/, orchestrator.ts, registry.yaml

- **Spec Evolution & Versioning**:
  - Semver for API versions (breaking → major, new endpoints → minor, fixes → patch)
  - Backwards compatibility via multiple version support (/v1, /v2)
  - Breaking change detection in CI/CD
  - 6-month deprecation migration path

- **Contract Testing**:
  - Tests written from spec BEFORE implementation
  - Request/response validation against OpenAPI schema
  - Auto-generated Postman collections
  - Schemathesis integration for fuzz testing

### Changed
- **Phase 2: Architecture** - Now SPEC-FIRST:
  1. Extract API requirements from PRD
  2. Generate OpenAPI 3.1 specification (BEFORE code)
  3. Generate artifacts from spec (types, SDK, stubs, docs)
  4. Select tech stack (based on spec requirements)
  5. Generate infrastructure requirements (from spec)
  6. Create project scaffolding (with contract testing)

- **Directory Structure** - Added new directories:
  - `.loki/specs/` - OpenAPI, GraphQL, AsyncAPI specifications
  - `.loki/mcp/` - MCP server implementations and registry
  - `.loki/logs/static-analysis/` - Static analysis results

- **Bootstrap Script** - Creates specs/ and mcp/ directories

### Philosophy
**"Be the best"** - Integrating top approaches from 2025:

1. **Agentic AI**: Autonomous agents that iterate, recognize errors, fix mistakes in real-time
2. **MCP**: Standardized agent communication for composability across platforms
3. **Spec-Driven Development**: Specifications as executable contracts, not afterthoughts

Loki Mode now combines the best practices from GitHub's ecosystem:
- **Speed**: Autonomous multi-agent development
- **Control**: Static analysis + AI review + spec validation
- **Interoperability**: MCP-compatible agents work with any AI platform
- **Quality**: Spec-first prevents drift, contract tests ensure compliance

"Specifications are the shared source of truth" - enabling parallel development, preventing API drift, and ensuring documentation accuracy.

## [2.12.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- **Quality Control Principles** - Integrated GitHub's "Speed Without Control" framework:

  **Principle 1: Guardrails, Not Just Acceleration**
  - Static analysis before AI review (CodeQL, ESLint, Pylint, type checking)
  - Automated detection of unused vars, duplicated logic, code smells
  - Cyclomatic complexity limits (max 15 per function)
  - Secret scanning to prevent credential leaks
  - 5 quality gate categories with blocking rules

  **Principle 2: Structured Prompting for Subagents**
  - All subagent dispatches must include: GOAL, CONSTRAINTS, CONTEXT, OUTPUT FORMAT
  - Goals explain "what success looks like" (not just actions)
  - Constraints define boundaries (dependencies, compatibility, performance)
  - Context includes CONTINUITY.md, ledgers, learnings, architecture decisions
  - Output format specifies deliverables (tests, docs, benchmarks)

  **Principle 3: Document Decisions, Not Just Code**
  - Every completed task requires decision documentation
  - WHY: Problem, root cause, solution chosen, alternatives considered
  - WHAT: Files modified, APIs changed, behavior changes, dependencies
  - TRADE-OFFS: Gains, costs, neutral changes
  - RISKS: What could go wrong, mitigation strategies
  - TEST RESULTS: Unit/integration/performance metrics
  - NEXT STEPS: Follow-up tasks

- **AI Slop Prevention** - Automated detection and blocking:
  - Warning signs: quality degradation, copy-paste duplication, over-engineering
  - Missing error handling, generic variable names, magic numbers
  - Commented-out code, TODO comments without issues
  - Auto-fail and re-dispatch with stricter constraints

- **Two-Stage Code Review**:
  - **Stage 1**: Static analysis (automated) runs first
  - **Stage 2**: AI reviewers (opus/sonnet) only after static analysis passes
  - AI reviewers receive static analysis results as context
  - Prevents wasting AI review time on issues machines can catch

- **Enhanced Task Schema**:
  - `payload.goal` - High-level objective (required)
  - `payload.constraints` - Array of limitations
  - `payload.context` - Related files, ADRs, previous attempts
  - `result.decisionReport` - Complete Why/What/Trade-offs documentation
  - Decision reports archived to `.loki/logs/decisions/`

### Changed
- CODE_REVIEW phase now requires static analysis before AI reviewers
- Subagent dispatch template updated with GOAL/CONSTRAINTS/CONTEXT/OUTPUT
- Task completion requires decision documentation (not just code output)
- Quality gates now include static analysis tools (CodeQL, linters, security scanners)
- Context-Aware Subagent Dispatch section rewritten for structured prompting

### Philosophy
"Speed and control aren't trade-offs. They reinforce each other." - GitHub

AI accelerates velocity but can introduce "AI slop" (semi-functional code accumulating technical debt). Loki Mode now pairs acceleration with visible guardrails: static analysis catches machine-detectable issues, structured prompting ensures intentional development, and decision documentation demonstrates thinking beyond shipping features.

## [2.11.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- **CONTINUITY.md Working Memory Protocol** - Inspired by OpenAI's persistent memory pattern:
  - Single working memory file at `.loki/CONTINUITY.md`
  - Read at START of every RAR (Reason-Act-Reflect) cycle
  - Update at END of every RAR cycle
  - Primary source of truth for "what am I doing right now?"

- **Working Memory Template** includes:
  - Active goal and current task tracking
  - Just completed items (last 5)
  - Next actions in priority order
  - Active blockers
  - Key decisions this session
  - Working context and files being modified

- **Memory Hierarchy Clarification**:
  1. `CONTINUITY.md` - Active working memory (every turn)
  2. `ledgers/` - Agent checkpoint state (on milestones)
  3. `handoffs/` - Transfer documents (on agent switch)
  4. `learnings/` - Pattern extraction (on task completion)
  5. `rules/` - Permanent validated patterns

### Changed
- RAR cycle now explicitly reads CONTINUITY.md in REASON phase
- RAR cycle now explicitly updates CONTINUITY.md in REFLECT phase
- Bootstrap script creates initial CONTINUITY.md
- Context Continuity Protocol updated to prioritize CONTINUITY.md
- Directory structure updated to show CONTINUITY.md at root of `.loki/`

### Philosophy
CONTINUITY.md provides a simpler, more explicit "every turn" memory protocol that complements the existing sophisticated memory system. It ensures Claude always knows exactly what it's working on, what just happened, and what needs to happen next.

## [2.10.1] - 2026-01-01

### Fixed
- **API Console Upload** - Added `loki-mode-api-X.X.X.zip` artifact for console.anthropic.com
  - API requires SKILL.md inside a folder wrapper (`loki-mode/SKILL.md`)
  - Claude.ai uses flat structure (`SKILL.md` at root)
  - Updated release workflow to generate both formats
  - Three release artifacts now available:
    - `loki-mode-X.X.X.zip` - for Claude.ai website
    - `loki-mode-api-X.X.X.zip` - for console.anthropic.com
    - `loki-mode-claude-code-X.X.X.zip` - for Claude Code CLI

## [2.10.0] - 2025-12-31

### Added
- **Context Memory Management System** - Inspired by Continuous-Claude-v2:
  - **Ledger-based state preservation** - Save state to `.loki/memory/ledgers/` instead of letting context degrade through compaction
  - **Agent Handoff System** - Clean context transfer between agents at `.loki/memory/handoffs/`
  - **Session Learnings** - Extract patterns and learnings to `.loki/memory/learnings/`
  - **Compound Rules** - Promote proven patterns to permanent rules at `.loki/rules/`
  - **Context Clear Signals** - Agent can request context reset via `.loki/signals/CONTEXT_CLEAR_REQUESTED`

- **Memory Directory Structure**:
  ```
  .loki/memory/
  ├── ledgers/     # Current state per agent
  ├── handoffs/    # Agent-to-agent transfers
  └── learnings/   # Extracted patterns
  .loki/rules/     # Permanent proven rules
  .loki/signals/   # Inter-process communication
  ```

- **Context Injection on Resume** - Wrapper now loads ledger and handoff context when resuming iterations

### Changed
- Prompts now include memory management instructions
- Wrapper initializes memory directory structure
- Build prompt includes ledger/handoff content for continuity

### Philosophy
Instead of "degrade gracefully through compression", Loki Mode now uses "reset cleanly with memory preservation" - ensuring perfect context continuity across unlimited iterations.

## [2.9.1] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed
- **Immediate continuation on success** - Successful iterations (exit code 0) now continue immediately
- No more 17+ minute waits between successful iterations
- Exponential backoff only applies to errors or rate limits

## [2.9.0] - 2025-12-31

### Added
- **Ralph Wiggum Mode** - True perpetual autonomous operation:
  - Reason-Act-Reflect (RAR) cycle for every iteration
  - Products are NEVER "complete" - always improvements to make
  - Stripped all interactive safety gates
  - Perpetual loop continues even when Claude claims completion

- **Perpetual Improvement Loop** - New philosophy:
  - Claude never declares "done" - there's always more to improve
  - When queue empties: find new improvements, run SDLC phases again, hunt bugs
  - Only stops on: max iterations, explicit completion promise, or user interrupt

- **New Environment Variables**:
  - `LOKI_COMPLETION_PROMISE` - EXPLICIT stop condition (must output exact text)
  - `LOKI_MAX_ITERATIONS` - Safety limit (default: 1000)
  - `LOKI_PERPETUAL_MODE` - Ignore ALL completion signals (default: false)

- **Completion Promise Detection** - Only stops when Claude outputs the exact promise text
  - Example: `LOKI_COMPLETION_PROMISE="ALL TESTS PASSING 100%"`
  - Claude must explicitly output "COMPLETION PROMISE FULFILLED: ALL TESTS PASSING 100%"

### Changed
- Default behavior now runs perpetually until max iterations
- Removed auto-completion based on "finalized" phase (was allowing hallucinated completion)
- Prompts now emphasize never stopping, always finding improvements
- SKILL.md completely rewritten for Ralph Wiggum Mode philosophy

## [2.8.1] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed
- **Dashboard showing all 0s** - Added explicit instructions to SKILL.md to use queue JSON files instead of TodoWrite tool
- Claude now properly populates `.loki/queue/*.json` files for live dashboard tracking
- Added queue system usage guide with JSON format and examples

### Changed
- SKILL.md now explicitly prohibits TodoWrite in favor of queue system
- Added "Task Management: Use Queue System" section with clear examples

## [2.8.0] - 2025-12-29

### Added
- **Smart Rate Limit Detection** - Automatically detects rate limit messages and waits until reset:
  - Parses "resets Xam/pm" from Claude output
  - Calculates exact wait time until reset (+ 2 min buffer)
  - Shows human-readable countdown (e.g., "4h 30m")
  - Longer countdown intervals for multi-hour waits (60s vs 10s)
  - No more wasted retry attempts during rate limits

### Changed
- Countdown display now shows human-readable format (e.g., "Resuming in 4h 28m...")

## [2.7.0] - 2025-12-28

### Added
- **Codebase Analysis Mode** - When no PRD is provided, Loki Mode now:
  1. **Auto-detects PRD files** - Searches for `PRD.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `SPEC.md`, `PROJECT.md` and docs variants
  2. **Analyzes existing codebase** - If no PRD found, performs comprehensive codebase analysis:
     - Scans directory structure and identifies tech stack
     - Reads package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, etc.
     - Examines README and entry points
     - Identifies current features and architecture
  3. **Generates PRD** - Creates `.loki/generated-prd.md` with:
     - Project overview and current state
     - Inferred requirements from implementation
     - Identified gaps (missing tests, security, docs)
     - Recommended improvements
  4. **Proceeds with SDLC** - Uses generated PRD as baseline for all testing phases

### Fixed
- Dashboard 404 errors - Server now runs from `.loki/` root to properly serve queue/state JSON files
- Updated dashboard URL to `/dashboard/index.html`

## [2.6.0] - 2025-12-28

### Added
- **Complete SDLC Testing Phases** - 11 comprehensive testing phases (all enabled by default):
  - `UNIT_TESTS` - Run existing unit tests with coverage
  - `API_TESTS` - Functional API testing with real HTTP requests
  - `E2E_TESTS` - End-to-end UI testing with Playwright/Cypress
  - `SECURITY` - OWASP scanning, auth flow verification, dependency audit

  - `ACCESSIBILITY` - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance testing
  - `REGRESSION` - Compare against previous version, detect regressions
  - `UAT` - User acceptance testing simulation, bug hunting
- **Phase Skip Options** - Each phase can be disabled via environment variables:
  - `LOKI_PHASE_UNIT_TESTS=false` to skip unit tests
  - `LOKI_PHASE_SECURITY=false` to skip security scanning
  - etc.

### Changed
- Prompt now includes `SDLC_PHASES_ENABLED: [...]` to inform Claude which phases to execute
- SKILL.md updated with detailed instructions for each SDLC phase

## [2.5.0] - 2025-12-28

- Simple HTML dashboard replaces Vibe Kanban (no external dependencies)

### Fixed
- Live output now actually streams (was buffered until completion in 2.4.0)
- Completion detection now recognizes `finalized` and `growth-loop` phases
- Prompt now explicitly instructs Claude to act autonomously without asking questions
- Added `.loki/COMPLETED` marker file detection for clean exit

## [2.4.0] - 2025-12-28
