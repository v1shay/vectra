# PRD: Purple Lab Platform -- Hosted Autonomous Development IDE

## Vision

Purple Lab becomes a hosted development platform like Replit, but for autonomous AI-powered development. Users describe what they want, agents build it, and they can browse/edit/preview/deploy -- all from the browser. Autonomi manages the infrastructure, storage, and compute. No CLI installation needed.

## Key Insight

Loki Mode already has 75+ commands and 120+ API endpoints. The platform doesn't need new capabilities -- it needs to surface existing ones through a production-grade web interface that matches or exceeds Replit's UX.

---

## Architecture: Local vs Hosted

**Current (Local):** User installs CLI, runs `loki start`, views results locally.

**Platform (Hosted):** User opens purplelab.dev (or app.autonomi.dev), types a prompt or picks a template, agents build on Autonomi infrastructure, user browses/edits/deploys from browser. Backend is the same server.py + run.sh, containerized per-workspace.

**Per-workspace container model:**
- Each project gets an isolated container (Docker or Firecracker)
- Container runs: Purple Lab server + loki CLI + language runtimes
- Persistent volume for project files
- Ephemeral compute for builds (scale to zero when idle)
- WebSocket proxy for real-time terminal/logs/preview

## Page Structure

### Page 1: Home (landing)
**URL:** `/`

**Layout:** Sidebar + main content (like Replit)

**Left sidebar:**
- Workspace name / avatar
- Navigation: Home, Projects, Templates, Integrations, Settings
- Bottom: Docs, Changelog, version

**Main content:**

---

### Page 2: Projects List
**URL:** `/projects`

**Layout:** Sidebar + grid/list

- Search and filter (status, date, provider, complexity)

- Actions: Open, Delete, Duplicate, Export
- Sorting: newest first, name, status

**Loki features surfaced:**
- Session history API -> project list
- `loki export` -> Export action
- `loki share` -> Share as Gist action

## Workspace Features Detail

### AI Chat Panel (Key differentiator from Replit)

This is the "Loki way" -- instead of just editing code, users can talk to the AI to iterate:

**Input:** Text prompt at bottom of workspace (like Replit's Agent chat)
**Behavior:**
1. User types "add a dark mode toggle"
2. Purple Lab creates amendment to PRD
3. Runs `loki start` in the background (or uses `loki quick` for small changes)
4. Real-time agent activity streams to Agent Log tab
5. File tree updates as agents create/modify files
6. Preview auto-refreshes when build completes
7. User can continue iterating

**This maps to Replit's "Agent modes":**
- **Quick mode** (like Lite): `loki quick "<prompt>"` -- 3 iterations, fast
- **Standard mode** (like Autonomous): `loki start` -- full RARV cycle
- **Max mode** (like Max): `loki start --complexity complex` -- extended iterations

### Quality Gates Panel

Shows the 9 Loki quality gates in real-time:
1. Static Analysis (CodeQL/ESLint)
2. 3-Reviewer Blind Review
3. Anti-Sycophancy Check
4. Severity Blocking (Critical/High)
5. Test Coverage (>80%)
6. Security Scan (OWASP)
7. Performance Check
8. Mock Detector
9. Mutation Detector

Each gate: name, status (pass/fail/pending), details expandable

### Agent Activity

Real-time grid showing which of the 41 agent types are active:
- Agent name, type, swarm, model tier (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku)
- Current task
- Status (working/idle/completed)
- Duration

### Memory System Viewer

Browse what the AI has learned across sessions:
- Episodic memory: specific interactions
- Semantic memory: generalized patterns
- Procedural memory: learned skills
- Token economics: discovery vs read efficiency

### Code Review Panel

When quality gates run, show results:
- Findings by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- File + line links (click to jump in editor)
- Suggested fixes
- Approve/Reject actions

---

## API Endpoints Needed (New)

Most features use existing endpoints. New ones needed for hosted platform:

1. `POST /api/workspace/create` -- create new workspace (container)
2. `DELETE /api/workspace/:id` -- destroy workspace
3. `GET /api/workspace/:id/status` -- container health
4. `POST /api/chat` -- send AI chat message (triggers loki quick/start)
5. `GET /api/templates` -- already exists
6. `POST /api/project/duplicate` -- clone a project
7. `POST /api/project/export` -- export as zip
8. `GET /api/project/:id/screenshot` -- generate thumbnail (headless browser or placeholder)
