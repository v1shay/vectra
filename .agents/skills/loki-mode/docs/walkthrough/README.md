## Design Conventions

All walkthroughs share a consistent design language:

- **Dark theme** with purple accent (#553DE9)
- **Inter** font for UI text, **JetBrains Mono** for code
- **Responsive** layouts that work on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Self-contained** HTML with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- **No external dependencies** beyond Google Fonts (optional, degrades gracefully)
